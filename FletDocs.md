# Introduction

## What is Flet?[​](/docs/#what-is-flet "Direct link to What is Flet?")

Flet is a framework that allows building web, desktop and mobile applications in Python without prior experience in frontend development.

You can build a UI for your program with Flet [controls](/docs/controls) which are based on [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) by Google. Flet goes beyond merely wrapping Flutter widgets. It adds its own touch by combining smaller widgets, simplifying complexities, implementing UI best practices, and applying sensible defaults. This ensures that your applications look stylish and polished without requiring additional design efforts on your part.

## Flet app example[​](/docs/#flet-app-example "Direct link to Flet app example")

Create a sample "Counter" app:

counter.py

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    page.title = "Flet counter example"    page.vertical_alignment = ft.MainAxisAlignment.CENTER    txt_number = ft.TextField(value="0", text_align=ft.TextAlign.RIGHT, width=100)    def minus_click(e):        txt_number.value = str(int(txt_number.value) - 1)        page.update()    def plus_click(e):        txt_number.value = str(int(txt_number.value) + 1)        page.update()    page.add(        ft.Row(            [                ft.IconButton(ft.Icons.REMOVE, on_click=minus_click),                txt_number,                ft.IconButton(ft.Icons.ADD, on_click=plus_click),            ],            alignment=ft.MainAxisAlignment.CENTER,        )    )ft.app(main)
```

To run the app install `flet` module ([create a new Flet environment](/docs/getting-started)):

```
pip install flet
```

and [run the program](/docs/getting-started/running-app):

```
flet run counter.py
```

The app will be started in a native OS window - what a nice alternative to Electron!

### macOS

### Windows

![](https://flet.dev/docs//img/docs/getting-started/flet-counter-windows.png)

Now, run your app as a web app:

```
flet run --web counter.py
```

A new browser window or tab will be opened:

## 2025[​](/roadmap#2025 "Direct link to 2025")

### Flet 1.0[​](/roadmap#flet-10 "Direct link to Flet 1.0")

-   **Long-term maintainability:** Controls are implemented using Python **dataclasses**, while the Flutter client adopts the built-in state management approach, eliminating the need for Redux. Ensures symmetric data structures in Python and Dart.
-   **Enhanced Developer Experience (DX):** Control documentation is generated directly from source code, preventing discrepancies between docs, comments, and examples. Provides accurate IDE assistance.
-   **Optimized Communication:** A binary protocol between Python and Dart eliminates unnecessary base64-to-bytes conversions, reducing CPU overhead and improving memory efficiency.

Flet 0.90 will be released as a preparatory step for Flet 1.0, introducing major changes, including breaking updates.

### Website[​](/roadmap#website "Direct link to Website")

## [Flet v0.26.0 Release Announcement](/blog/flet-v-0-26-release-announcement)

January 24, 2025 · 4 min read

[![Feodor Fitsner](https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5041459?s=400&v=4)](https://github.com/FeodorFitsner)

[Feodor Fitsner](https://github.com/FeodorFitsner)

Flet founder and developer

The Flet 0.26.0 release is here, featuring a significant update to the extensibility approach!

In summary, a Flet extension is now a single Python package that bundles both Python and Flutter code. This package can be part of your Flet project or hosted in a public Git repository or PyPI.

Built-in Flet extensions, such as `Audio`, `Video`, and `Map`, have been moved to their own repositories. You’re welcome to fork these extensions to create your own or contribute to Flet! These extensions have been published to PyPI, making them easy to include in your Flet app. To use them, simply add the desired extensions to the `dependencies` section of your `pyproject.toml` file.

For more details, see below.

## How to upgrade[​](/blog#how-to-upgrade "Direct link to How to upgrade")

Run the following command to upgrade Flet:

```
pip install 'flet[all]' --upgrade
```

note

`[all]` is an "extra" specifier which tells pip to install or upgrade all `flet` packages: `flet`, `flet-cli`, `flet-desktop` and `flet-web`.

Bump `flet` package version to `0.26.0` (or remove it at all to use the latest) in your `pyproject.toml`.

## Extensibility changes[​](/blog#extensibility-changes "Direct link to Extensibility changes")

### Built-in extensions[​](/blog#built-in-extensions "Direct link to Built-in extensions")

Flet controls based on 3rd-party Flutter packages that used to be a part of Flet repository, now have been moved to separate repos and published on pypi:

-   [flet-ads](https://pypi.org/project/flet-ads/)
-   [flet-audio](https://pypi.org/project/flet-audio/)
-   [flet-audio-recorder](https://pypi.org/project/flet-audio-recorder/)
-   [flet-flashlight](https://pypi.org/project/flet-flashlight/)
-   [flet-geolocator](https://pypi.org/project/flet-geolocator/)
-   [flet-lottie](https://pypi.org/project/flet-lottie/)
-   [flet-map](https://pypi.org/project/flet-map/)
-   [flet-permission-handler](https://pypi.org/project/flet-permission-handler/)
-   [flet-rive](https://pypi.org/project/flet-rive/)
-   [flet-video](https://pypi.org/project/flet-video/)
-   [flet-webview](https://pypi.org/project/flet-webview/)

To use a built-in Flet extension in your project, add it to the `dependencies` section of your `pyproject.toml` file, for example:

```
dependencies = [  "flet-audio",  "flet>=0.26.0",]
```

### User extensions[​](/blog#user-extensions "Direct link to User extensions")

Flet now makes it easy to create and build projects with your custom controls based on Flutter widgets or Flutter 3rd-party packages:

1.  Create new virtual enviroment and [install Flet](/docs/getting-started/#python-venv-module) there.
    
2.  Create new Flet extension project from template:
    

```
flet create --template extension --project-name my-control
```

A project with new MyControl control will be created. The control is just a Flutter Text widget with a single `text` property.

3.  Build your app.

Flet project created from extension template has `examples/my_control_example` folder with the example app.

When in the folder where your `pyproject.toml` for the app is, run `flet build` command, for example, for macOS:

```
flet build macos -v
```

Run the app and see the new custom Flet Control:

```
open build/macos/my-control-example.app
```

![](https://flet.dev/blog/img/blog/extensions/example.png)

Read more about how to customise your extension [here](/docs/extend/user-extensions).

## Development environment configuration[​](/blog#development-environment-configuration "Direct link to Development environment configuration")

To enhance the developer experience with the `flet build` command, Flet 0.26.0 ensures that the correct versions of Flutter SDK, Java (JDK), and Android SDK are installed. If any of these are missing or outdated, it automatically installs them for you.

You still need to install Visual Studio 2022 yourself if you're building a Flet app for Windows, or Xcode if you're building for iOS or macOS.

In the next releases we are going to introduce automatic configuration and startup of Android and iOS emulators.

## Flutter 3.27[​](/blog#flutter-327 "Direct link to Flutter 3.27")

Flet has been migrated to Flutter SDK 3.27. See [this pull request](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet/pull/4703) for new and updated control properties.

## Python 3.9[​](/blog#python-39 "Direct link to Python 3.9")

Flet 0.26.0 requires Python 3.9 or later. Python 3.8 has reached [EOL](https://devguide.python.org/versions/).

## [Flet v0.25.0 Release Announcement](/blog/flet-v-0-25-release-announcement)

Flet founder and developer

Hey Flet developers, we’ve got something exciting to share — Flet 0.25.0 is officially released!

The biggest news? No more Kivy for iOS and Android packaging. No more dealing with frustrating Python binary dependencies — Flet now uses its own custom Python runtime, so your app builds are easier than ever. Plus, we’ve added loads of new features like better permissions control, faster rebuilds, and even a lightweight Linux client that skips the bloat.

Let’s dive into all the cool stuff Flet 0.25.0 has to offer! 🚀

## How to upgrade[​](/blog#how-to-upgrade "Direct link to How to upgrade")

Run the following command to upgrade Flet:

```
pip install 'flet[all]' --upgrade
```

note

`[all]` is an "extra" specifier which tells pip to install all `flet` package dependencies. See [New Python packages structure](/blog#new-python-packages-structure) section below for the explanation.

Bump `flet` package version to `0.25.0` (or remove it at all to use the latest) in `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`.

## New packaging[​](/blog#new-packaging "Direct link to New packaging")

Flet packaging for iOS and Android has been relying on Kivy and it was super annoying when your app depends on Python binary packages, such as Numpy or Pillow. You needed to compile those packages yourself using Kivy command line tools. It was really frustrating and even hopeless if Kivy didn't have "recipes" for some packages, like Pydantic.

Flet does not depend on Kivy anymore and uses its own Python runtime "meticulously crafted in-house".

Flet packaging implementation for iOS and Androind adheres to strict specifications defined in [PEP 730](https://peps.python.org/pep-0730/) (iOS) and [PEP 738](https://peps.python.org/pep-0738/) (Android) which were implemented and released in Python 3.13 (and back-ported to Python 3.12). When pypi.org supports wheel tags for iOS and Android and 3rd-party Python package maintainers start uploading their mobile packages Flet will be compatible with them and you'll be able to use them in your Flet app.

### Pre-built binary packages[​](/blog#pre-built-binary-packages "Direct link to Pre-built binary packages")

`flet build` command for iOS and Android is now installing pre-built binary packages from [https://pypi.flet.dev](https://pypi.flet.dev).

New packages can be built with creating a recipe in [Mobile Forge](https://github.com/flet-dev/mobile-forge) project. For now, Flet team is authoring those recipes for you, but when the process is polished and fully-automated you'll be able to send a PR and test the compiled package right away.

If you don't yet see a package you require at [https://pypi.flet.dev](https://pypi.flet.dev), you can request it in [Flet discussions - Packages](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet/discussions/categories/packages). Please do not request pure Python packages. Go to package's "Download files" section at [https://pypi.org](https://pypi.org) and make sure it contains binary platform-specific wheels.

Packaging behavior was changed too:

-   The packaging is not trying to replace `flet` dependency with `flet-runtime`, `flet-embed` or `flet-pyodide`, but install all dependencies "as is" from `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` - thanks to the [new Flet packages structure](/blog#new-python-packages-structure).
-   If the binary package for target platform is not found the packaging won't be trying to compile it from source distribution, but will fail instead with a meaningful error.

### Python 3.12[​](/blog#python-312 "Direct link to Python 3.12")

Packaged Flet app runs on Python 3.12.7 runtime on all platforms.

### Permissions[​](/blog#permissions "Direct link to Permissions")

New `flet build` command allows granular control over permissions, features and entitlements embedded into `AndroidManifest.xml`, `Info.plist` and `.entitlements` files.

No more hard-coded permissions in those files!

For example, setting permissions for iOS bundle:

```
flet build --info-plist NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription="This app uses location service when in use."
```

or the same in `pyproject.toml` (read about `pyproject.toml` support below):

```
[tool.flet.ios.info] # --info-plistNSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription = "This app uses location service when in use."
```

An example of setting Android permissions and features:

```
flet build \    --android-permissions android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE=True \      android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE=True \    --android-features android.hardware.location.network=False
```

[Read more about permissions in the docs](/docs/publish#permissions).

### Control over app compilation and cleanup[​](/blog#control-over-app-compilation-and-cleanup "Direct link to Control over app compilation and cleanup")

`flet build` command is no longer compiling app `.py` files into `.pyc` by default which allows you to defer discovery of any syntax errors in your app and complete the packaging.

You can control the compilation and cleanup with the following new options:

-   `--compile-app` - compile app's `.py` files.
-   `--compile-packages` - compile installed packages' `.py` files.
-   `--cleanup-on-compile` - remove unnecessary files upon successful compilation.

### Signing Android bundles[​](/blog#signing-android-bundles "Direct link to Signing Android bundles")

We also added new options for signing Android builds:

-   `--android-signing-key-store` - path to an upload keystore `.jks` file for Android apps.
-   `--android-signing-key-store-password` - Android signing store password.
-   `--android-signing-key-alias` - Android signing key alias. Default is "upload".
-   `--android-signing-key-password` - Android signing key password.

Read [Build and release an Android app](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/android#signing-the-app) for more information on how to configure upload key for Android builds.

### Deep linking configuration[​](/blog#deep-linking-configuration "Direct link to Deep linking configuration")

There is a new `--deep-linking-url` option to configure deep linking for iOS and Android builds. The value must be in the format `<sheme>://<host>`.

### Faster re-builds[​](/blog#faster-re-builds "Direct link to Faster re-builds")

Ephemeral Flutter app created by `flet build` command is no longer being re-created on every build in a temp directory, but cached in `build/flutter` directory which gives faster re-builds, improves packaging troubleshooting and does not pollute user temp directory.

You can use `--clear-cache` option to do a clean build though.

### Split APKs per ABI[​](/blog#split-apks-per-abi "Direct link to Split APKs per ABI")

`flet build` now provides the built-in `--split-per-abi` option to split the APKs per ABIs.

## "Data" and "Temp" directories for the app[​](/blog#data-and-temp-directories-for-the-app "Direct link to \"Data\" and \"Temp\" directories for the app")

Flet developers have been asking where to store application data, such as uploaded files, SQLite databases, etc. that are persistent across application updates.

This release introduce two environment variables that are available in your Flet apps:

-   `FLET_APP_STORAGE_DATA` - directory for storing application data that is preserved between app updates. That directory is already pre-created and its location depends on the platform the app is running on.
-   `FLET_APP_STORAGE_TEMP` - directory for temporary application files, i.e. cache. That directory is already pre-created and its location depends on the platform the app is running on.

For example, data folder path can be read in your app as:

```
import os# it's `None` when running the app in web modedata_dir = os.getenv("FLET_APP_STORAGE_DATA")
```

note

`flet run` command creates data and temp directories and sets `FLET_APP_STORAGE_DATA` and `FLET_APP_STORAGE_TEMP` to their paths.

## `pyproject.toml` support[​](/blog#pyprojecttoml-support "Direct link to pyprojecttoml-support")

It's inconvenient and bulky to carry all `flet build` settings as command line options.

In Flet 0.25.0 release is now possible to configure `flet build`, `flet run`, and `flet publish` settings in `pyproject.toml`!

Flet adds `tool.flet` section and sub-sections to `pyproject.toml`. Here's the minimal version of `pyproject.toml` you can put into root folder of your app:

```
[project]name = "my_app"version = "1.0.0"description = "My first Flet project"authors = [  {name = "John Smith", email = "john@email.com"}]dependencies = ["flet"]
```

You can also generate a starting `pyproject.toml` (and other files) for your project with `flet create` command.

## New Python packages structure[​](/blog#new-python-packages-structure "Direct link to New Python packages structure")

We re-factored Flet Python packages and removed `flet-core`, `flet-runtime`, `flet-embed` or`flet-pyodide` packages.

The new structure avoids rewriting pip dependencies while installing `flet` package on various platforms. There was a problem of detecting the correct `flet` package to install (`flet-runtime`, `flet-embed` or`flet-pyodide`?) if `flet` was not a direct dependency in user's app.

New Flet packages:

-   `flet` - required for minimal Flet setup, app entry point for various platforms with core logic and controls. Installed on all platforms.
-   `flet-cli` - contains Flet CLI commands. Installed on desktop only.
-   `flet-desktop` - contains pre-built Flet "client" app binary for macOS, Windows and Linux. By default installed on macOS and Windows desktops only.
-   `flet-desktop-light` - contains a light-weight version (without Audio and Video controls) of Flet "client" for Linux. By default installed on Linux desktops only.
-   `flet-web` - contains Flet web "client" and FastAPI integration. Installed on desktop only.

Packaged Flet app contains only `flet` package now.

### `flet` package extras[​](/blog#flet-package-extras "Direct link to flet-package-extras")

`flet` package defines the following extras that can be specified when installing Flet with pip, uv, poetry and other package manager:

-   `flet[all]` - installs `flet`, `flet-cli`, `flet-desktop` and `flet-web`. Recommended for development.
-   `flet[cli]` - installs `flet` and `flet-cli`. Can be used in CI environment for packaging only.
-   `flet[web]` - installs `flet` and `flet-web`. Used for deploying Flet web apps.
-   `flet[desktop]` - installs `flet` and `flet-desktop`. Used for desktop-only development.

### New Flet install and upgrade commands[​](/blog#new-flet-install-and-upgrade-commands "Direct link to New Flet install and upgrade commands")

Starting from this release the development version of `flet` package should be installed with the following command:

```
pip install 'flet[all]'
```

Ugrading `flet` package:

```
pip install 'flet[all]' --upgrade
```

note

`pip install flet` still works too, but it will install `flet` package only and dependent packages will be installed on demand. For example, when you run any `flet` CLI command `flet-cli` will be installed, or when you run `flet run` command `flet-desktop` package will be installed.

## "Light" client for Linux[​](/blog#light-client-for-linux "Direct link to \"Light\" client for Linux")

A lightweight desktop client, without Audio and Video controls, is now installed on Linux by default. It improves initial user experience as user doesn't need to immediately deal with `gstreamer` (audio) and `mpv` (video) dependencies and Flet "just works".

Once user got some Flet experience and wants to use Video and Audio controls in their application they can install gstreamer and/or mpv and replace Flet desktop with a full version.

Uninstall "light" Flet client:

```
pip uninstall flet-desktop-light --yes
```

Install full Flet desktop client:

```
pip install flet-desktop
```

## New controls[​](/blog#new-controls "Direct link to New controls")

-   Mobile Ads (`Banner` and `Interstitial`) ([details and example](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet/pull/3288)).
-   `Button` control ([#4265](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet/pull/4265)) - which is just an alias for `ElevatedButton` control.

## Breaking changes[​](/blog#breaking-changes "Direct link to Breaking changes")

-   Refactor `Badge` Control to a Dataclass; added new `badge` property to all controls ([#4077](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet/pull/4077)).

Below is how to migrate:

```
# before    page.navigation_bar = ft.NavigationBar(        destinations=[            ft.NavigationBarDestination(                icon_content=ft.Badge(                    content=ft.Icon(ft.Icons.PHONE),                    text=10,                ),                label="Calls",            ),        ]    )# after    page.navigation_bar = ft.NavigationBar(        destinations=[            ft.NavigationBarDestination(                  icon=ft.Icon(                        ft.Icons.PHONE,                        badge="10",                    ),                label="Calls",            ),        ]    )
```

## [pyproject.toml support for flet build command](/blog/pyproject-toml-support-for-flet-build-command)

October 15, 2024 · 5 min read

[![Feodor Fitsner](https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5041459?s=400&v=4)](https://github.com/FeodorFitsner)

[Feodor Fitsner](https://github.com/FeodorFitsner)

Flet founder and developer

The number of options for `flet build` command grew substantially over the time and it's been inconvenient to carry all these settings in a command line.

Today, we are excited to announce another Flet pre-release which now allows configuring app build settings in `pyproject.toml`!

## Installing pre-release[​](/blog#installing-pre-release "Direct link to Installing pre-release")

```
pip install flet==0.25.0.dev3526
```

note

For testing purposes we suggest installing Flet pre-release in a dedicated Python virtual environment.

## Building the app with pre-release[​](/blog#building-the-app-with-pre-release "Direct link to Building the app with pre-release")

To build your app with `flet build` command and pre-release version of Flet make sure your `requirements.txt` either contains exact version specifier:

```
flet==0.25.0.dev3526
```

or `--pre` flag before `flet` dependency:

```
--preflet
```

## Quick start[​](/blog#quick-start "Direct link to Quick start")

Create the following minimal `pyproject.toml` file in the root of your Flet app or run `flet create` to create a new app from template:

```
[project]name = "my_app"version = "1.0.0"description = "My first Flet project"authors = [  {name = "John Smith", email = "john@email.com"}]dependencies = ["flet==0.25.0.dev3526"]
```

note

With `pyproject.toml`, you no longer need `requirements.txt`. However, if a `requirements.txt` file exists in the app's directory, the flet build command will prioritize reading dependencies from it instead of those listed in `pyproject.toml`.

`[project]` is the standard required section of `project.toml`.

note

Flet also supports `[tool.poetry]` section created by Poetry which contains project settings.

A minimal `pyproject.toml` for Poetry, which is also supported by `flet build` command, is the following:

```
[tool.poetry]name = "my_app"version = "1.0.0"description = "My first Flet project"authors = ["John Smith <john@email.com>"][tool.poetry.dependencies]python = "^3.10"flet = "0.25.0.dev3526"
```

`project.name` (or `tool.poetry.name`) corresponds to `--project` option of `flet build` command and it will be the name of app bundle or executable. The value of `project.name` will be "slugified" where all non-alphanumeric values are replaced with dashes `-`.

`project.version` (or `tool.poetry.version`) corresponds to `--build-version` option and it is a value in "x.y.z" string used as the version number shown to users.

`project.description` (or `tool.poetry.description`) corresponds to `--description` option which is the description to use for executable or bundle.

note

`project.authors` and `tool.poetry.authors` are not used by `flet build`, but required by a standard and other tools.

### Overriding config with CLI options[​](/blog#overriding-config-with-cli-options "Direct link to Overriding config with CLI options")

All settings in `pyproject.toml` have corresponding `flet build` CLI options. If you run the flet build command and specify options that are already configured in `pyproject.toml`, the CLI option values will override those from the configuration file.

## Project dependencies[​](/blog#project-dependencies "Direct link to Project dependencies")

List project dependencies in `project.dependencies` section. The value is an array with pip-like requirement specifiers:

```
[project]dependencies = [  "flet==0.25.0.dev3526",  "numpy"]
```

## Product information[​](/blog#product-information "Direct link to Product information")

All Flet specific settings should be put into `[tool.flet]` section and sub-sections below it.

Product information settings complement the ones in `[project]` section and allows configuring app bundle identifier and product display name.

```
[tool.flet]org = "com.mycompany" # --orgproduct = "Product name" # --productcompany = "My Company" # --companycopyright = "Copyright (C) 2024 by MyCompany" # --copyrightbuild_number = 1 # --build-number
```

## App package contents[​](/blog#app-package-contents "Direct link to App package contents")

The following settings control the contents of Python app archive and compilation of app/packages sources.

```
[tool.flet]app.module = "main" # --module-nameapp.path = "src" # path to Python app relative to `pyproject.toml`app.exclude = ["assets"] # --excludecompile.app = false # --compile-appcompile.packages = false # --compile-packagescompile.cleanup = false # --cleanup-on-compile
```

They could be alternatively written under their own sub-sections as:

```
[tool.flet.app]module = "main"path = "src"exclude = ["assets"][tool.flet.compile]app = falsepackages = falsecleanup = false
```

## Splash[​](/blog#splash "Direct link to Splash")

```
[tool.flet.splash]color = "" # --splash-colordark_color = "" # --splash-dark-colorweb = false # --no-web-splashios = false # --no-ios-splashandroid = false # --no-android-splash
```

## Permissions[​](/blog#permissions "Direct link to Permissions")

```
[tool.flet]permissions = ["camera", "microphone"] # --permissions
```

## Deep linking[​](/blog#deep-linking "Direct link to Deep linking")

```
[tool.flet.deep_linking]scheme = "https" # --deep-linking-schemehost = "mydomain.com" # --deep-linking-host

## [Flet new packaging pre-release](/blog/flet-new-packaging-pre-release)

October 10, 2024 · 8 min read

[Feodor Fitsner](https://github.com/FeodorFitsner)

Flet founder and developer

Flet packaging for iOS and Android has been relying on Kivy and it was super annoying when your app depends on Python binary packages, such as Numpy or Pillow. You needed to compile those packages yourself using Kivy command line tools. It was really frustrating and even hopeless if Kivy didn't have "recipes" for some packages, like Pydantic.

Kivy no more! We've just published Flet 0.25.0.dev3519 pre-release with the improved `flet build` command which does not use Kivy! Flet is now using its own Python runtime "meticulously crafted in-house".

Flet packaging implementation for iOS and Androind adheres to strict specifications defined in [PEP 730](https://peps.python.org/pep-0730/) (iOS) and [PEP 738](https://peps.python.org/pep-0738/) (Android) which were implemented and released in Python 3.13 (and back-ported to Python 3.12). When pypi.org supports wheel tags for iOS and Android and 3rd-party Python package maintainers start uploading their mobile packages Flet will be compatible with them and you'll be able to use them in your Flet app.

## Installing pre-release[​](/blog#installing-pre-release "Direct link to Installing pre-release")

```
pip install flet==0.25.0.dev3519
```

note

For testing purposes we suggest installing Flet pre-release in a dedicated Python virtual environment.

## Building the app with pre-release[​](/blog#building-the-app-with-pre-release "Direct link to Building the app with pre-release")

To build your app with `flet build` command and pre-release version of Flet make sure your `requirements.txt` either contains exact version specifier:

```
flet==0.25.0.dev3519
```

or `--pre` flag before `flet` dependency:

```
--preflet
```

## Python 3.12[​](/blog#python-312 "Direct link to Python 3.12")

Packaged Flet app runs on Python 3.12.6 runtime for all platforms.

## Pre-built binary packages[​](/blog#pre-built-binary-packages "Direct link to Pre-built binary packages")

`flet build` command for iOS and Android is now installing pre-built binary packages from [https://pypi.flet.dev](https://pypi.flet.dev).

New packages can be built with creating a recipe in [Mobile Forge](https://github.com/flet-dev/mobile-forge) project. For now, Flet team is authoring those recipes for you, but when the process is polished and fully-automated you'll be able to send a PR and test the compiled package right away.

If you don't yet see a package at [https://pypi.flet.dev](https://pypi.flet.dev) you can request it in [Flet discussions - Packages](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet/discussions/categories/packages). Please do not request pure Python packages. Go to package's "Download files" section at [https://pypi.org](https://pypi.org) and make sure it contains binary platform-specific wheels.

Packaging behavior was changed too:

-   The packaging is not trying to replace `flet` dependency with `flet-runtime`, `flet-embed` or `flet-pyodide`, but install all dependencies "as is" from `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` - thanks to the new Flet packages structure (link).
-   If the binary package for target platform is not found the packaging won't be trying to compile it from source distribution, but will fail instead with a meaningful error.

## New packages structure[​](/blog#new-packages-structure "Direct link to New packages structure")

The structure avoids rewriting pip dependencies while installing `flet` package on various platforms. There was a problem of detecting the correct `flet` package to install (`flet-runtime`, `flet-embed` or`flet-pyodide`?) if `flet` was not a direct dependency in user's app.

New Flet packages:

-   `flet` - required for minimal Flet setup, app entry point for various platforms. Installed on all platforms.
-   `flet-core` - required for minimal Flet setup, core logic and controls. Installed on all platforms.
-   `flet-cli` - contains Flet CLI commands. Installed on desktop only.
-   `flet-desktop` - contains pre-built Flet "client" app binary for macOS, Windows and Linux. By default installed on macOS and Windows desktops only.
-   `flet-desktop-light` - contains a light-weight version (without Audio and Video controls) of Flet "client" for Linux. By default installed on Linux desktops only.
-   `flet-web` - contains Flet web "client" and FastAPI integration. Installed on desktop only.

Other words, packaged Flet app contains only `flet` and `flet-core` packages.

### "Light" client for Linux[​](/blog#light-client-for-linux "Direct link to \"Light\" client for Linux")

A light-weight desktop client, without Audio and Video controls, is not installed on Linux by default. It improves initial user experience as user doesn't need to immediately deal with gstreamer (audio) and mpv (video) dependencies right away and Flet "just works".

Once user got some Flet experience and wants to use Video and Audio controls in their application they can install gstreamer and/or mpv and replace Flet desktop with a full version.

Uninstall "light" Flet client:

```
pip uninstall flet-desktop-light --yes
```

Install full Flet desktop client:

```
pip install flet-desktop==0.25.0.dev3519
```

## Permissions[​](/blog#permissions "Direct link to Permissions")

New `flet build` command allows granular control over permissions, features and entitlements embedded into `AndroidManifest.xml`, `Info.plist` and `.entitlements` files.

No more hard-coded permissions in those files!

### iOS[​](/blog#ios "Direct link to iOS")

Setting iOS permissions:

```
flet build --info-plist permission_1=True|False|description permission_2=True|False|description ...
```

For example:

```
flet build --info-plist NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription=This app uses location service when in use.
```

### macOS[​](/blog#macos "Direct link to macOS")

Setting macOS entitlements:

```
flet build --macos-entitlements name_1=True|False name_2=True|False ...
```

Default macOS entitlements:

-   `com.apple.security.app-sandbox = False`
-   `com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit = True`
-   `com.apple.security.network.client = True`
-   `com.apple.security.network.server" = True`

### Android[​](/blog#android "Direct link to Android")

Setting Android permissions and features:

```
flet build --android-permissions permission=True|False ... --android-features feature_name=True|False
```

For example:

```
flet build \    --android-permissions android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE=True \      android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE=True \    --android-features android.hardware.location.network=False
```

Default Android permissions:

-   `android.permission.INTERNET`

Default permissions can be disabled with `--android-permissions` option and `False` value, for example:

```
flet build --android-permissions android.permission.INTERNET=False
```

Default Android features:

-   `android.software.leanback=False` (`False` means it's written in manifest as `android:required="false"`)
-   `android.hardware.touchscreen=False`

### Cross-platform permission groups[​](/blog#cross-platform-permission-groups "Direct link to Cross-platform permission groups")

There are pre-defined permissions that mapped to `Info.plist`, `*.entitlements` and `AndroidManifest.xml` for respective platforms.

Setting cross-platform permissions:

```
flet build --permissions permission_1 permission_2 ...
```

Supported permissions:

-   `location`
-   `camera`
-   `microphone`
-   `photo_library`

#### iOS mapping to `Info.plist` entries[​](/blog#ios-mapping-to-infoplist-entries "Direct link to ios-mapping-to-infoplist-entries")

-   `location`
    -   `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription = This app uses location service when in use.`
    -   `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription = This app uses location service.`
-   `camera`
    -   `NSCameraUsageDescription = This app uses the camera to capture photos and videos.`

-   `photo_library`
    -   permissions:
        -   `android.permission.READ_MEDIA_VISUAL_USER_SELECTED": True`

## Control over app compilation and cleanup[​](/blog#control-over-app-compilation-and-cleanup "Direct link to Control over app compilation and cleanup")

`flet build` command is no longer compiling app `.py` files into `.pyc` by default which allows you to avoid (defer?) discovery of any syntax errors in your app and complete the packaging.

You can control the compilation and cleanup with the following new options:

-   `--compile-app` - compile app's `.py` files.
-   `--compile-packages` - compile installed packages' `.py` files.
-   `--cleanup-on-compile` - remove unnecessary files upon successful compilation.

## Signing Android bundles[​](/blog#signing-android-bundles "Direct link to Signing Android bundles")

Added new options for signing Android builds:

-   `--android-signing-key-store` - path to an upload keystore `.jks` file for Android apps.
-   `--android-signing-key-store-password` - Android signing store password.
-   `--android-signing-key-alias` - Android signing key alias. Default is "upload".
-   `--android-signing-key-password` - Android signing key password.

Read [Build and release an Android app](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/android#signing-the-app) for more information on how to configure upload key for Android builds.

## "Data" and "Temp" directories for the app[​](/blog#data-and-temp-directories-for-the-app "Direct link to \"Data\" and \"Temp\" directories for the app")

Flet developers have been asking where to store application data, such as uploaded files, SQLite databases, etc. that are persistent across application updates.

This release introduce two environment variables that are available in your Flet apps:

-   `FLET_APP_STORAGE_DATA` - directory for storing application data that is preserved between app updates. That directory is already pre-created.
-   `FLET_APP_STORAGE_TEMP` - directory for temporary application files, i.e. cache. That directory is already pre-created.

For example, data folder path can be read in your app as:

```
import os# it's `None` when running the app in web modedata_dir = os.getenv("FLET_APP_STORAGE_DATA")
```

note

`flet run` command creates data and temp directories and sets `FLET_APP_STORAGE_DATA` and `FLET_APP_STORAGE_TEMP` to their paths.

## Deep linking configuration[​](/blog#deep-linking-configuration "Direct link to Deep linking configuration")

There is a new `--deep-linking-url` option to configure deep linking for iOS and Android builds. The value must be in the format `<sheme>://<host>`.

## Faster re-builds[​](/blog#faster-re-builds "Direct link to Faster re-builds")

Ephemeral Flutter app created by `flet build` command is not re-created all the time in a temp directory, but cached in `build/flutter` directory which gives faster re-builds, improves packaging troubleshooting and does not pollute temp directory.

## Split APKs per ABI[​](/blog#split-apks-per-abi "Direct link to Split APKs per ABI")

`flet build` now provides the built-in `--split-per-abi` option to split the APKs per ABIs.

## Known pre-release issues[​](/blog#known-pre-release-issues "Direct link to Known pre-release issues")

-   `flet publish` is not yet working.

## What else coming in the release[​](/blog#what-else-coming-in-the-release "Direct link to What else coming in the release")

We would like to include a few more things into Flet 0.25.0 release. Expect more pre-releases in the coming weeks.

### `pyproject.toml` support[​](/blog#pyprojecttoml-support "Direct link to pyprojecttoml-support")

It's inconvenient and bulky to carry all `flet build` settings as command line options.

You will be able to store project and build settings in `[tool.flet]` section of `pyproject.toml`.

### Running Flet app on simulator[​](/blog#running-flet-app-on-simulator "Direct link to Running Flet app on simulator")

We will add an option to `flet build` and run packaged app on a real device or simulator.

### Installing Flutter[​](/blog#installing-flutter "Direct link to Installing Flutter")

`flet build` will download and configure Flutter for you if there is no suitable installation available on your machine.

## Enhancements[​](/blog#enhancements "Direct link to Enhancements")

-   Better string output of Events when printed
-   `Image.filter_quality` now has a default of `FilterQuality.MEDIUM` (previously `FilterQuality.LOW`), which is a better default for downscaled images.
-   `Geolocator` control has been improved to support location streaming through the newly added on\_position\_change event. When defined, you will be able to "listen" to location changes as they happen.
-   When `AppBar.adaptive=True` and the app is running on an Apple platform, the `AppBar.actions` controls are now wrapped in a `Row`, then displayed. Before this, only the first item of `AppBar.actions` list was displayed.
-   The `Markdown` control has been significantly improved. It can now display SVG images and be much more customized.
-   A very requested feature was the ability to set a background image or gradient for the application. In [#3820](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet/pull/3820), we made this possible and easy to use.
-   rtl (right-to-left) property has been added to more controls (`NavigationRailDestination`, `NavigationRail`, `AppBar`, `CupertinoAppBar`, and `NavigationDrawer` ) to improve support for right-to-left text directions.
-   Introduced `--no-rich-output` flag (only in `flet build` command for now) to make it possible to disable rich output (mainly emojis) in the console. More information in [#3708](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet/pull/3708).
-   Typing has been significantly improved, particularly for event-handler properties. In modern IDEs like PyCharm and VSCode, you can now easily determine the type of an event handler's argument by simply hovering over the event in the control. Additionally, the IDE will highlight errors when you attempt to access a non-existent property on the event handler argument, ensuring more robust and error-free code.

## Breaking Changes and Migration[​](/blog#breaking-changes-and-migration "Direct link to Breaking Changes and Migration")

### Tooltip[​](/blog#tooltip "Direct link to Tooltip")

The Tooltip class is no more a Flet control and is from now on a simple Python dataclass. The tooltip property (available in almost all controls) now supports both strings and Tooltip objects.

Below is how to migrate:

```
# beforepage.add(    ft.Tooltip(        message="This is tooltip",        content=ft.Text("Hover to see tooltip"),        padding=20,        border_radius=10,    ))# afterpage.add(    ft.Text(        "Hover to see tooltip",        tooltip=ft.Tooltip(            message="This is tooltip",            padding=20,            border_radius=10,        )    ))

### TextField InputFilter[​](/blog#textfield-inputfilter "Direct link to TextField InputFilter")

We modified how `InputFilter.regex_string` is internally handled. As a result of this, you (might) now have to anchor your regex pattern. This simply implies using start (^) and end ($) regex anchors. For example: `r"[0-9]"` now becomes `r"^[0-9]$"`. Using this new string will lead work as expected and only numbers/digits will be allowed, but you might notice another issue: the last character of the text field cannot be deleted. To resolve this, you need to add an asterisk (\*) in the regex which in this case will simply mean "match zero or more digits (including an empty string)". The new regex now becomes `r"^[0-9]*$"`. To ease this migration, you can use an AI tool with the following simple prompt: `"update the following regex pattern: #### ensuring that the entire string matches the pattern and it allows for an empty string"`.

### Event-Handler subscription[​](/blog#event-handler-subscription "Direct link to Event-Handler subscription")

The possibility to "subscribe" more than one callback to an event handler has been removed, as this was somehow biased (was only possible on some, and not all). Below is a simple example:

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    def print_one(e):        print("1")    def print_two(e):        print("2")    def print_three(e):        print("3")    c = ft.Container(        bgcolor=ft.Colors.random_color(),        width=300,        height=300,    )        # subscribe callbacks    c.on_tap_down = print_one    c.on_tap_down = print_two    c.on_tap_down = print_three    page.add(c)ft.app(main)
```

In the above code, we subscribe multiple callbacks to the [`Container.on_tap_down`](/docs/controls/container#on_tap_down) event. Prior to Flet version 0.24.0, running this code and tapping on the `Container`, you will see all the callbacks getting called ("1", "2" and "3" are printed out). From Flet version 0.24.0 going forward, one event = one callback. Meaning only the lastly subscribed callback will get executed ("3" is printed out) So, if you still want the final output to resemble the first one you can simply create one callback which calls the others:

```
def main(page: ft.Page):    #....      def print_all(e):            print_one(e)            print_two(e)            print_three(e)        c = ft.Container(            bgcolor=ft.Colors.random_color(),            width=300,            height=300,            on_tap_down=print_all,        )    # OR    c.on_tap_down = print_all
```

## Conclusion[​](/blog#conclusion "Direct link to Conclusion")

As you can see, we made a lot of changes in this release and as usual, your feedback is highly welcomed!

Upgrade to Flet 0.24.0, test your apps and let us know how you find the new features we added. If you have any questions, please join [Flet Discord server](https://discord.gg/dzWXP8SHG8) or create a new thread on [Flet GitHub discussions](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet/discussions).

# Getting started

Before you can create your first Flet app you need to setup your development environment which requires Python 3.9 or above and `flet` package.

We recommend installing Flet in a virtual environment which can be done in a number of different ways.

## Prerequisites[​](/docs/getting-started/#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

### macOS[​](/docs/getting-started/#macos "Direct link to macOS")

Flet supports macOS 11 (Big Sur) or later.

### Windows[​](/docs/getting-started/#windows "Direct link to Windows")

Flet supports 64-bit version of Microsoft Windows 10 or later.

### Linux[​](/docs/getting-started/#linux "Direct link to Linux")

Flet supports Debian Linux 11 or later and Ubuntu Linux 20.04 LTS or later.

There are additional [prerequisites](/docs/publish/linux#prerequisites) when developing and running Flet apps on Linux.

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

Flet apps can be run on WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2). If you are getting `cannot open display` error [following this guide](https://github.com/microsoft/wslg/wiki/Diagnosing-%22cannot-open-display%22-type-issues-with-WSLg) for troubleshooting.

#### Audio support[​](/docs/getting-started/#audio-support "Direct link to Audio support")

If you recieve `error while loading shared libraries: libgstapp-1.0.so.0` GStreamer is not installed in your WSL environment.

To install GStreamer run the following command:

```
apt install -y libgstreamer1.0-0 gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly gstreamer1.0-libav gstreamer1.0-tools
```

#### Video support[​](/docs/getting-started/#video-support "Direct link to Video support")

Video support in Flet on WSL requires `libmpv` library.

If you recieve `error while loading shared libraries: libmpv.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory` it means the library is not installed.

To install `libmpv` run the following commands:

```
sudo apt updatesudo apt install libmpv-dev libmpv2sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmpv.so /usr/lib/libmpv.so.1
```

## Virtual environment[​](/docs/getting-started/#virtual-environment "Direct link to Virtual environment")

You can create virtual environment by running the following commands in your terminal:

-   macOS
-   Linux
-   Windows

```
mkdir first-flet-appcd first-flet-apppython3 -m venv .venvsource .venv/bin/activate
```

```
mkdir first-flet-appcd first-flet-apppython3 -m venv .venvsource .venv/bin/activate
```

```
md first-flet-appcd first-flet-apppython -m venv .venv.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Once you activated virtual environment, you'll see that your prompt now shows `(.venv)` prefix.

Now you can install the latest version of Flet in `.venv` virtual environment:

-   macOS
-   Linux
-   Windows

```
pip install 'flet[all]'
```

```
pip install flet[all]
```

```
pip install flet[all]
```

To check what version of Flet was installed:

```
flet --version
```

You can read more about Python `venv` module [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

Now you are ready to [create your first Flet app](/docs/getting-started/create-flet-app).

## Poetry[​](/docs/getting-started/#poetry "Direct link to Poetry")

Another way to setup a virtual environment for your Flet project is using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

Poetry 2.0

All Poetry examples in Flet docs is for Poetry 2.0 as it supports standard `[project]` section in `pyproject.toml`.

Once you have Poetry [installed](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation), run the following commands in your terminal:

```
mkdir my-appcd my-apppoetry init --dev-dependency='flet[all]' --python='>=3.9' --no-interaction
```

This command will create `pyproject.toml` in `my-app` directory.

Run the following command to install Flet and other dependencies:

```
poetry install --no-root
```

Make sure Flet CLI has been installed and can be run:

```
poetry run flet --version
```

Now you are ready to [create your first Flet app](/docs/getting-started/create-flet-app).

note

When [creating](/docs/getting-started/create-flet-app) and [running](/docs/getting-started/running-app) Flet app using Poetry, you'll need to use `poetry run` before each command!

## uv[​](/docs/getting-started/#uv "Direct link to uv")

**uv** is "An extremely fast Python package and project manager, written in Rust."

[Install `uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) and run the following commands in your terminal:

```
mkdir my-appcd my-appuv init
```

This command will create `pyproject.toml` in `my-app` directory.

Run the following command to add Flet as dependency:

```
uv add 'flet[all]' --dev
```

Make sure Flet CLI has been installed and can be run:

```
uv run flet --version
```

Now you are ready to [create your first Flet app](/docs/getting-started/create-flet-app).

note

When [creating](/docs/getting-started/create-flet-app) and [running](/docs/getting-started/running-app) Flet app using uv, you'll need to use `uv run` before each command!

# Create a new Flet app

Create a new directory (or directory with `pyproject.toml` already exists if initialized with `poetry` or `uv`) and switch into it.

To create a new "minimal" Flet app run the following command:

-   venv
-   uv
-   poetry

```
flet create
```

```
uv run flet create
```

```
poetry run flet create
```

The command will create the following directory structure:

```
├── README.md├── pyproject.toml├── src│   ├── assets│   │   └── icon.png│   └── main.py└── storage    ├── data    └── temp
```

note

Original `pyproject.toml` created by `uv init` or `poetry init` will be replaced with the one from Flet app template.

`src/main.py` contains Flet program. It has `main()` function where you would add UI elements ([controls](/docs/getting-started/flet-controls)) to a page or a window. The application ends with a blocking `ft.app()` function which initializes Flet app and [runs](/docs/getting-started/running-app) `main()`.

You can find more information about `flet create` command [here](/docs/reference/cli/create).

Now let's see Flet in action by [running the app](/docs/getting-started/running-app)!

# Running Flet app

Flet app can be run as a desktop or web app using a single `flet run` command.

## Run as a desktop app[​](/docs/getting-started/running-app#run-as-a-desktop-app "Direct link to Run as a desktop app")

To run Flet app as a desktop app, use the following command:

```
flet run
```

This command will run `main.py` located in the current directory.

If you need to provide a different path to the file, use the following command:

```
flet run [script]
```

To run `main.py` located in a different directory, provide an absolute or a relative path to the directory where it is located, for example:

```
flet run /Users/JohnSmith/Documents/projects/flet-app
```

To run script with a name other than `main.py`, provide an absolute or a relative path to the file, for example:

```
flet run counter.py
```

The app will be started in a native OS window:

### macOS

![](https://flet.dev/docs/getting-started/running-app/img/docs/getting-started/flet-counter-macos.png)

### Windows

![](https://flet.dev/docs/getting-started/running-app/img/docs/getting-started/flet-counter-windows.png)

## Run as a web app[​](/docs/getting-started/running-app#run-as-a-web-app "Direct link to Run as a web app")

To run Flet app as a web app, use the following command:

```
flet run --web [script]
```

A new browser window/tab will be opened and the app will be using a random TCP port:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/getting-started/running-app/img/docs/getting-started/flet-counter-safari.png)

To run on a fixed port use `--port` (`-p`) option, for example:

```
flet run --web --port 8000 app.py
```

## Hot reload[​](/docs/getting-started/running-app#hot-reload "Direct link to Hot reload")

By default, Flet will watch the script file that was run and reload the app whenever the file is changed and saved, but will not watch for changes in other files.

To watch all the files in the same directory, use the following command:

```
poetry run flet run -d [script]
```

To watch script directory and all sub-directories recursively, use the following command:

```
poetry run flet run -d -r [script]
```

You can find more information about `flet run` command [here](/docs/reference/cli/run).

User interface is made of **Controls** (aka widgets). To make controls visible to a user they must be added to a `Page` or inside other controls. Page is the top-most control. Nesting controls into each other could be represented as a tree with Page as a root.

Controls are just regular Python classes. Create control instances via constructors with parameters matching their properties, for example:

```
t = ft.Text(value="Hello, world!", color="green")
```

To display control on a page add it to `controls` list of a Page and call `page.update()` to send page changes to a browser or desktop client:

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    t = ft.Text(value="Hello, world!", color="green")    page.controls.append(t)    page.update()ft.app(main)
```

![](https://flet.dev/docs/getting-started/flet-controls/img/docs/getting-started/controls-text.png)

note

In the following examples we will be showing just the contents of `main` function.

You can modify control properties and the UI will be updated on the next `page.update()`:

```
t = ft.Text()page.add(t) # it's a shortcut for page.controls.append(t) and then page.update()for i in range(10):    t.value = f"Step {i}"    page.update()    time.sleep(1)
```

Some controls are "container" controls (like Page) which could contain other controls. For example, `Row` control allows arranging other controls in a row one-by-one:

```
page.add(    ft.Row(controls=[        ft.Text("A"),        ft.Text("B"),        ft.Text("C")    ]))
```

or `TextField` and `ElevatedButton` next to it:

```
page.add(    ft.Row(controls=[        ft.TextField(label="Your name"),        ft.ElevatedButton(text="Say my name!")    ]))
```

`page.update()` is smart enough to send only the changes made since its last call, so you can add a couple of new controls to the page, remove some of them, change other controls' properties and then call `page.update()` to do a batched update, for example:

```
for i in range(10):    page.controls.append(ft.Text(f"Line {i}"))    if i > 4:        page.controls.pop(0)    page.update()    time.sleep(0.3)
```

Some controls, like buttons, could have event handlers reacting on a user input, for example `ElevatedButton.on_click`:

```
def button_clicked(e):    page.add(ft.Text("Clicked!"))page.add(ft.ElevatedButton(text="Click me", on_click=button_clicked))
```

and more advanced example for a simple To-Do:

```
import flet as ftdef main(page):    def add_clicked(e):        page.add(ft.Checkbox(label=new_task.value))        new_task.value = ""        new_task.focus()        new_task.update()    new_task = ft.TextField(hint_text="What's needs to be done?", width=300)    page.add(ft.Row([new_task, ft.ElevatedButton("Add", on_click=add_clicked)]))ft.app(main)
```

info

Flet implements *imperative* UI model where you "manually" build application UI with stateful controls and then mutate it by updating control properties. Flutter implements *declarative* model where UI is automatically re-built on application data changes. Managing application state in modern frontend applications is inherently complex task and Flet's "old-school" approach could be more attractive to programmers without frontend experience.

### `visible` property[​](/docs/getting-started/flet-controls#visible-property "Direct link to visible-property")

Every control has `visible` property which is `true` by default - control is rendered on the page. Setting `visible` to `false` completely prevents control (and all its children if any) from rendering on a page canvas. Hidden controls cannot be focused or selected with a keyboard or mouse and they do not emit any events.

### `disabled` property[​](/docs/getting-started/flet-controls#disabled-property "Direct link to disabled-property")

Every control has `disabled` property which is `false` by default - control and all its children are enabled. `disabled` property is mostly used with data entry controls like `TextField`, `Dropdown`, `Checkbox`, buttons. However, `disabled` could be set to a parent control and its value will be propagated down to all children recursively.

For example, if you have a form with multiple entry control you can set `disabled` property for each control individually:

```
first_name = ft.TextField()last_name = ft.TextField()first_name.disabled = Truelast_name.disabled = Truepage.add(first_name, last_name)
```

or you can put form controls into container, e.g. `Column` and then set `disabled` for the column:

```
first_name = ft.TextField()last_name = ft.TextField()c = ft.Column(controls=[    first_name,    last_name])c.disabled = Truepage.add(c)
```

## Buttons[​](/docs/getting-started/flet-controls#buttons "Direct link to Buttons")

`Button` is the most essential input control which generates `click` event when pressed:

```
btn = ft.ElevatedButton("Click me!")page.add(btn)
```

![](https://flet.dev/docs/getting-started/flet-controls/img/docs/getting-started/getting-user-input-elevated-button.png)

All events generated by controls on a web page are continuously sent back to your script, so how do you respond to a button click?

## Event handlers[​](/docs/getting-started/flet-controls#event-handlers "Direct link to Event handlers")

Buttons with events in "Counter" app:

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    page.title = "Flet counter example"    page.vertical_alignment = ft.MainAxisAlignment.CENTER    txt_number = ft.TextField(value="0", text_align="right", width=100)    def minus_click(e):        txt_number.value = str(int(txt_number.value) - 1)        page.update()    def plus_click(e):        txt_number.value = str(int(txt_number.value) + 1)        page.update()    page.add(        ft.Row(            [                ft.IconButton(ft.Icons.REMOVE, on_click=minus_click),                txt_number,                ft.IconButton(ft.Icons.ADD, on_click=plus_click),            ],            alignment=ft.MainAxisAlignment.CENTER,        )    )ft.app(main)
```

## Textbox[​](/docs/getting-started/flet-controls#textbox "Direct link to Textbox")

Flet provides a number of [controls](/docs/controls) for building forms: [TextField](/docs/controls/textfield), [Checkbox](/docs/controls/checkbox), [Dropdown](/docs/controls/dropdown), [ElevatedButton](/docs/controls/elevatedbutton).

Let's ask a user for a name:

```
import flet as ftdef main(page):    def btn_click(e):        if not txt_name.value:            txt_name.error_text = "Please enter your name"            page.update()        else:            name = txt_name.value            page.clean()            page.add(ft.Text(f"Hello, {name}!"))    txt_name = ft.TextField(label="Your name")    page.add(txt_name, ft.ElevatedButton("Say hello!", on_click=btn_click))ft.app(main)
```

![](https://flet.dev/docs/getting-started/flet-controls/img/docs/getting-started/getting-user-input-textbox.png)

## Checkbox[​](/docs/getting-started/flet-controls#checkbox "Direct link to Checkbox")

The [Checkbox](/docs/controls/checkbox) control provides you with various properties and events emmiters for ease of use.

Let's create a one checkbox ToDo:

```
import flet as ftdef main(page):    def checkbox_changed(e):        output_text.value = (            f"You have learned how to ski :  {todo_check.value}."        )        page.update()    output_text = ft.Text()    todo_check = ft.Checkbox(label="ToDo: Learn how to use ski", value=False, on_change=checkbox_changed)    page.add(todo_check, output_text)ft.app(main)
```

![](https://flet.dev/docs/getting-started/flet-controls/img/docs/getting-started/getting-user-input-checkbox.png)

## Dropdown[​](/docs/getting-started/flet-controls#dropdown "Direct link to Dropdown")

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    def button_clicked(e):        output_text.value = f"Dropdown value is:  {color_dropdown.value}"        page.update()    output_text = ft.Text()    submit_btn = ft.ElevatedButton(text="Submit", on_click=button_clicked)    color_dropdown = ft.Dropdown(        width=100,        options=[            ft.dropdown.Option("Red"),            ft.dropdown.Option("Green"),            ft.dropdown.Option("Blue"),        ],    )    page.add(color_dropdown, submit_btn, output_text)ft.app(main)
```

# Custom controls

While Flet provides 100+ built-in controls that can be used on their own, the real beauty of programming with Flet is that all those controls can be utilized for creating your own reusable UI components using Python object-oriented programming concepts.

You can create custom controls in Python by styling and/or combining existing Flet controls.

## Styled controls[​](/docs/getting-started/custom-controls#styled-controls "Direct link to Styled controls")

The most simple custom control you can create is a styled control, for example, a button of a certain color and behaviour that will be used multiple times throughout your app.

To create a styled control, you need to create a new class in Python that inherits from the Flet control you are going to customize, `ElevatedButton` in this case:

```
class MyButton(ft.ElevatedButton):    def __init__(self, text):        super().__init__()        self.bgcolor = ft.Colors.ORANGE_300        self.color = ft.Colors.GREEN_800        self.text = text     
```

Your control has a constructor to customize properties and events and pass custom data. Note that you must call `super().__init__()` in your own constructor to have access to the properties and methods of the Flet control from which you inherit.

Now you can use your brand-new control in your app:

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    page.add(MyButton(text="OK"), MyButton(text="Cancel"))ft.app(main)
```

![](https://flet.dev/docs/getting-started/custom-controls/img/docs/custom-controls/styled-controls.png)

See example of using styled controls in [Calculator App tutorial](/docs/tutorials/python-calculator#styled-controls).

### Handling events[​](/docs/getting-started/custom-controls#handling-events "Direct link to Handling events")

Similar to properties, you can pass event handlers as parameters into your custom control class constructor:

```
import flet as ftclass MyButton(ft.ElevatedButton):    def __init__(self, text, on_click):        super().__init__()        self.bgcolor = ft.Colors.ORANGE_300        self.color = ft.Colors.GREEN_800        self.text = text        self.on_click = on_clickdef main(page: ft.Page):    def ok_clicked(e):        print("OK clicked")        def cancel_clicked(e):        print("Cancel clicked")    page.add(        MyButton(text="OK", on_click=ok_clicked),        MyButton(text="Cancel", on_click=cancel_clicked),    )ft.app(main)
```

## Composite controls[​](/docs/getting-started/custom-controls#composite-controls "Direct link to Composite controls")

Composite custom controls inherit from container controls such as `Column`, `Row`, `Stack` or even `View` to combine multiple Flet controls. The example below is a `Task` control that can be used in a To-Do app:

```
import flet as ftclass Task(ft.Row):    def __init__(self, text):        super().__init__()        self.text_view = ft.Text(text)        self.text_edit = ft.TextField(text, visible=False)        self.edit_button = ft.IconButton(icon=ft.Icons.EDIT, on_click=self.edit)        self.save_button = ft.IconButton(            visible=False, icon=ft.Icons.SAVE, on_click=self.save        )        self.controls = [            ft.Checkbox(),            self.text_view,            self.text_edit,            self.edit_button,            self.save_button,        ]    def edit(self, e):        self.edit_button.visible = False        self.save_button.visible = True        self.text_view.visible = False        self.text_edit.visible = True        self.update()    def save(self, e):        self.edit_button.visible = True        self.save_button.visible = False        self.text_view.visible = True        self.text_edit.visible = False        self.text_view.value = self.text_edit.value        self.update()def main(page: ft.Page):    page.add(        Task(text="Do laundry"),        Task(text="Cook dinner"),    )ft.app(main)
```

![](https://flet.dev/docs/getting-started/custom-controls/img/docs/custom-controls/composite-controls.gif)

You can find more examples of composite custom controls in [community examples](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/tree/main/python/community) and [flet-contrib](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet-contrib/tree/main/flet_contrib) repos.

## Life-cycle methods[​](/docs/getting-started/custom-controls#life-cycle-methods "Direct link to Life-cycle methods")

Custom controls provide life-cycle "hook" methods that you may need to use for different use cases in your app.

### `build()`[​](/docs/getting-started/custom-controls#build "Direct link to build")

`build()` method is called when the control is being created and assigned its `self.page`.

Override `build()` method if you need to implement logic that cannot be executed in control's constructor because it requires access to the `self.page`. For example, choose the right icon depending on `self.page.platform` for your [adaptive app](/docs/getting-started/adaptive-apps/#custom-adaptive-controls).

### `did_mount()`[​](/docs/getting-started/custom-controls#did_mount "Direct link to did_mount")

`did_mount()` method is called after the control is added to the page and assigned transient `uid`.

Override `did_mount()` method if you need to implement logic that needs to be executed after the control was added to the page, for example [Weather widget](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/tree/main/python/community/weather_widget) which calls Open Weather API every minute to update itself with the new weather conditions.

### `will_unmount()`[​](/docs/getting-started/custom-controls#will_unmount "Direct link to will_unmount")

`will_unmount()` method is called before the control is removed from the page.

Override `will_unmount()` method to execute clean-up code.

### `before_update()`[​](/docs/getting-started/custom-controls#before_update "Direct link to before_update")

`before_update()` method is called every time when the control is being updated.

Make sure not to call `update()` method within `before_update()`.

## Isolated controls[​](/docs/getting-started/custom-controls#isolated-controls "Direct link to Isolated controls")

Custom control has `is_isolated` property which defaults to `False`.

If you set `is_isolated` to `True`, your control will be isolated from outside layout, i.e. when `update()` method is called for the parent control, the control itself will be updated but any changes to the controls' children are not included into the update digest. Isolated controls should call `self.update()` to push its changes to a Flet page.

As a best practice, any custom control that calls `self.update()` inside its class methods should be isolated.

In the above examples, simple styled `MyButton` doesn't need to be isolated, but the `Task` should be:

```
class Task(ft.Row):    def __init__(self, text):        super().__init__()        self.isolated = True
```

# Adaptive apps

Flet framework allows you to develop adaptive apps which means having a single codebase that will deliver different look depending on the device's platform.

Below is the example of a very simple app that has a different look on iOS and Android platforms:

```
import flet as ftdef main(page):    page.adaptive = True    page.appbar = ft.AppBar(        leading=ft.TextButton("New", style=ft.ButtonStyle(padding=0)),        title=ft.Text("Adaptive AppBar"),        actions=[            ft.IconButton(ft.cupertino_icons.ADD, style=ft.ButtonStyle(padding=0))        ],        bgcolor=ft.Colors.with_opacity(0.04, ft.CupertinoColors.SYSTEM_BACKGROUND),    )    page.navigation_bar = ft.NavigationBar(        destinations=[            ft.NavigationBarDestination(icon=ft.Icons.EXPLORE, label="Explore"),            ft.NavigationBarDestination(icon=ft.Icons.COMMUTE, label="Commute"),            ft.NavigationBarDestination(                icon=ft.Icons.BOOKMARK_BORDER,                selected_icon=ft.Icons.BOOKMARK,                label="Bookmark",            ),        ],        border=ft.Border(            top=ft.BorderSide(color=ft.CupertinoColors.SYSTEM_GREY2, width=0)        ),    )    page.add(        ft.SafeArea(            ft.Column(                [                    ft.Checkbox(value=False, label="Dark Mode"),                    ft.Text("First field:"),                    ft.TextField(keyboard_type=ft.KeyboardType.TEXT),                    ft.Text("Second field:"),                    ft.TextField(keyboard_type=ft.KeyboardType.TEXT),                    ft.Switch(label="A switch"),                    ft.FilledButton(content=ft.Text("Adaptive button")),                    ft.Text("Text line 1"),                    ft.Text("Text line 2"),                    ft.Text("Text line 3"),                ]            )        )    )ft.app(main)
```

By setting just `page.adaptive = True` you can make you app looking awesome on both iOS and Android devices:

## Material and Cupertino controls[​](/docs/getting-started/adaptive-apps#material-and-cupertino-controls "Direct link to Material and Cupertino controls")

Most of Flet controls are based on [Material design](https://m3.material.io/).

There is also a number of iOS-style controls in Flet that are called Cupertino controls.

Cupertino controls usually have a matching Material control that has [`adaptive`](/docs/controls#adaptive) property which defaults to`False`. When using a Material control with `adaptive` property set to `True`, a different control will be created depending on the platform, for example:

```
ft.Checkbox(adaptive=True, value=True, label="Adaptive Checkbox")
```

Flet checks the value of [`page.platform`](/docs/controls/page#platform) property and if it is `ft.PagePlatform.IOS` or `ft.PagePlatform.MACOS`, Cupertino control will be created; in all other cases Material control will be created.

note

[`adaptive`](/docs/controls#adaptive) property can be set for an individual control or a container control such as `Row`, `Column` or any other control that has `content` or `controls` property. If container control is adaptive, all its child controls will be adaptive, unless `adaptive` property is explicitly set to `False` for a child control.

## Custom adaptive controls[​](/docs/getting-started/adaptive-apps#custom-adaptive-controls "Direct link to Custom adaptive controls")

While Flet offers a number of [controls](/docs/getting-started/adaptive-apps#material-and-cupertino-controls) that will be adapted to a platform automatically using their [`adaptive`](/docs/controls#adaptive) property, there will be cases when you need more specific adaptive UI presentation, for example, using different icon, background color, padding etc. depending on the platform.

With Flet, you can create your own reusable custom controls in Python that will inherit from a Flet control and implement specific properties you need. In the example below, we are creating a new `AdaptiveNavigationBarDestination` control that will be displaying different icon on iOS and Android:

```
class AdaptiveNavigationBarDestination(ft.NavigationBarDestination):    def __init__(self, ios_icon, android_icon, label):        super().__init__()        self._ios_icon = ios_icon        self._android_icon = android_icon        self.label = label    def build(self):        # we can check for platform in build method because self.page is known        self.icon = (            self._ios_icon            if self.page.platform == ft.PagePlatform.IOS            or self.page.platform == ft.PagePlatform.MACOS            else self._android_icon        )
```

We will use `AdaptiveNavigationBarDestination` in `NavigationBar`:

```
import flet as ftfrom adaptive_navigation_destination import AdaptiveNavigationBarDestinationdef main(page):    page.adaptive = True    page.navigation_bar = ft.NavigationBar(        selected_index=2,        destinations=[            AdaptiveNavigationBarDestination(                ios_icon=ft.cupertino_icons.PERSON_3_FILL,                android_icon=ft.Icons.PERSON,                label="Contacts",            ),            AdaptiveNavigationBarDestination(                ios_icon=ft.cupertino_icons.CHAT_BUBBLE_2,                android_icon=ft.Icons.CHAT,                label="Chats",            ),            AdaptiveNavigationBarDestination(                ios_icon=ft.cupertino_icons.SETTINGS,                android_icon=ft.Icons.SETTINGS,                label="Settings",            ),        ],    )    page.update()ft.app(main)
```

Now the NavigationBar and icons within it will look like different on Android and iOS:

### iOS

![](https://flet.dev/docs/getting-started/adaptive-apps/img/docs/adaptive-apps/navigation-bar-custom-ios.png)

### Android

![](https://flet.dev/docs/getting-started/adaptive-apps/img/docs/adaptive-apps/navigation-bar-custom-android.png)

note

You may utilise [reusable controls approach](/docs/getting-started/custom-controls) to adapt your app not only depending on the [`platform`](/docs/controls/page#platform) but also use [`page.web`](/docs/controls/page#web) property to have different UI depending on wether the app is running in a browser or not, or even combine `platform` and `web` properties to have specific UI for your MACOS or Windows desktop apps.

# Navigation and routing

Navigation and routing is an essential feature of Single Page Applications (SPA) which allows organizing application user interface into virtual pages (views) and "navigate" between them while application URL reflects the current state of the app.

For mobile apps navigation and routing serves as a [deep linking](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/navigation/deep-linking) to specific application parts.

Well, it took [more efforts](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet/pull/95/files) than expected to add navigation and routing into Flet as the implementation is based on [Navigator 2.0](https://medium.com/flutter/learning-flutters-new-navigation-and-routing-system-7c9068155ade) Flutter API and required to replace Flet's "Page" abstraction with "Page and Views". Flutter's newer navigation and routing API has substantial improvements such as:

1.  Programmatic control over history stack.
2.  An easy way to intercept a call to "Back" button in AppBar.
3.  Robust synchronization with browser history.

![](https://flet.dev/docs/getting-started/navigation-and-routing/img/docs/navigation-routing/routing-app-example.gif)

Explore [source code](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/main/python/apps/routing-navigation/building-views-on-route-change.py) of the example above.

## Page route[​](/docs/getting-started/navigation-and-routing#page-route "Direct link to Page route")

Page route is a portion of application URL after `#` symbol:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/getting-started/navigation-and-routing/img/docs/navigation-routing/page-address-route.png)

Default application route, if not set in application URL by the user, is `/`. All routes start with `/`, for example `/store`, `/authors/1/books/2`.

Application route can be obtained by reading `page.route` property, for example:

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    page.add(ft.Text(f"Initial route: {page.route}"))ft.app(main, view=ft.AppView.WEB_BROWSER)
```

Grab application URL, open a new browser tab, paste the URL, modify its part after `#` to `/test` and hit enter. You should see "Initial route: /test".

Every time the route in the URL is changed (by editing the URL or navigating browser history with Back/Forward buttons) Flet calls `page.on_route_change` event handler:

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    page.add(ft.Text(f"Initial route: {page.route}"))    def route_change(e: ft.RouteChangeEvent):        page.add(ft.Text(f"New route: {e.route}"))    page.on_route_change = route_change    page.update()ft.app(main, view=ft.AppView.WEB_BROWSER)
```

Now try updating URL hash a few times and then use Back/Forward buttons! You should see a new message added to a page each time the route changes:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/getting-started/navigation-and-routing/img/docs/navigation-routing/page-route-change-event.gif)

Route can be changed programmatically, by updating `page.route` property:

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    page.add(ft.Text(f"Initial route: {page.route}"))    def route_change(e: ft.RouteChangeEvent):        page.add(ft.Text(f"New route: {e.route}"))    def go_store(e):        page.route = "/store"        page.update()    page.on_route_change = route_change    page.add(ft.ElevatedButton("Go to Store", on_click=go_store))ft.app(main, view=ft.AppView.WEB_BROWSER)
```

Click "Go to Store" button and you'll see application URL is changed and a new item is pushed in a browser history. You can use browser "Back" button to navigate to a previous route.

## Page views[​](/docs/getting-started/navigation-and-routing#page-views "Direct link to Page views")

Flet's [Page](/docs/controls/page) now is not just a single page, but a container for [View](/docs/controls/view) layered on top of each other like a sandwich:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/getting-started/navigation-and-routing/img/docs/navigation-routing/page-views.svg)

A collection of views represents navigator history. Page has [`page.views`](/docs/controls/page#views) property to access views collection.

The last view in the list is the one currently displayed on a page. Views list must have at least one element (root view).

To simulate a transition between pages change `page.route` and add a new `View` in the end of `page.view` list.

Pop the last view from the collection and change route to a "previous" one in [`page.on_view_pop`](/docs/controls/page#on_view_pop) event handler to go back.

## Building views on route change[​](/docs/getting-started/navigation-and-routing#building-views-on-route-change "Direct link to Building views on route change")

To build a reliable navigation there must be a single place in the program which builds a list of views depending on the current route. Other words, navigation history stack (represented by the list of views) must be a function of a route.

This place is [`page.on_route_change`](/docs/controls/page#on_route_change) event handler.

Let's put everything together into a complete example which allows navigating between two pages:

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    page.title = "Routes Example"    def route_change(route):        page.views.clear()        page.views.append(            ft.View(                "/",                [                    ft.AppBar(title=ft.Text("Flet app"), bgcolor=ft.Colors.SURFACE_VARIANT),                    ft.ElevatedButton("Visit Store", on_click=lambda _: page.go("/store")),                ],            )        )        if page.route == "/store":            page.views.append(                ft.View(                    "/store",                    [                        ft.AppBar(title=ft.Text("Store"), bgcolor=ft.Colors.SURFACE_VARIANT),                        ft.ElevatedButton("Go Home", on_click=lambda _: page.go("/")),                    ],                )            )        page.update()    def view_pop(view):        page.views.pop()        top_view = page.views[-1]        page.go(top_view.route)    page.on_route_change = route_change    page.on_view_pop = view_pop    page.go(page.route)ft.app(main, view=ft.AppView.WEB_BROWSER)
```

Try navigating between pages using "Visit Store" and "Go Home" buttons, Back/Forward browser buttons, manually changing route in the URL - it works no matter what! :)

note

To "navigate" between pages we used [`page.go(route)`](/docs/controls/page#goroute) - a helper method that updates [`page.route`](/docs/controls/page#route), calls [`page.on_route_change`](/docs/controls/page#on_route_change) event handler to update views and finally calls `page.update()`.

Notice the usage of [`page.on_view_pop`](/docs/controls/page#on_view_pop) event handler. It fires when the user clicks automatic "Back" button in [`AppBar`](/docs/controls/appbar) control. In the handler we remove the last element from views collection and navigate to view's root "under" it.

## Route templates[​](/docs/getting-started/navigation-and-routing#route-templates "Direct link to Route templates")

Flet offers [`TemplateRoute`](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet/blob/main/sdk/python/packages/flet-core/src/flet_core/template_route.py) - an utility class based on [repath](https://github.com/nickcoutsos/python-repath) library which allows matching ExpressJS-like routes and parsing their parameters, for example `/account/:account_id/orders/:order_id`.

`TemplateRoute` plays great with route change event:

```
troute = TemplateRoute(page.route)if troute.match("/books/:id"):    print("Book view ID:", troute.id)elif troute.match("/account/:account_id/orders/:order_id"):    print("Account:", troute.account_id, "Order:", troute.order_id)else:    print("Unknown route")
```

You can read more about template syntax supported by `repath` library [here](https://github.com/nickcoutsos/python-repath#parameters).

## URL strategy for web[​](/docs/getting-started/navigation-and-routing#url-strategy-for-web "Direct link to URL strategy for web")

Flet web apps support two ways of configuring URL-based routing:

-   **Path** (default) - paths are read and written without a hash. For example, `fletapp.dev/path/to/view`.
-   **Hash** - paths are read and written to the [hash fragment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator#Syntax). For example, `fletapp.dev/#/path/to/view`.

To change URL strategy use `route_url_strategy` parameter of `flet.app()` method, for example:

```
ft.app(main, route_url_strategy="hash")
```

URL strategy for Flet Server can be configured with `FLET_ROUTE_URL_STRATEGY` environment variable which could be set to either `path` (default) or `hash`.

# Testing Flet app on iOS

Start building awesome mobile apps in Python using just your computer and mobile phone!

Install [Flet](https://apps.apple.com/app/flet/id1624979699) app to your iOS device. You will be using this app to see how your Flet project is working on iPhone or iPad.

[![](https://flet.dev/docs/getting-started/testing-on-ios/img/docs/getting-started/testing-on-ios/qr-code.jpg)](https://apps.apple.com/app/flet/id1624979699)

To get started on your computer you need Python 3.9 or greater installed.

Important

Your iOS device and computer must be connected to the same Wi-Fi or local network.

It's recommended to start with the creation of a new virtual environment:

-   macOS
-   Linux
-   Windows

```
python3 -m venv .venvsource .venv/bin/activate
```

```
python3 -m venv .venvsource .venv/bin/activate
```

```
python.exe -m venv .venv.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Next, install the latest `flet` package:

```
pip install flet --upgrade
```

Ensure that Flet has successfully installed and Flet CLI is available in `PATH` by running:

```
flet --version
```

Create a new Flet project:

```
flet create my-appcd my-app
```

Run the following command to start Flet development server with your app:

```
flet run --ios
```

A QR code with encoded project URL will be displayed in the terminal:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/getting-started/testing-on-ios/img/docs/getting-started/testing-on-ios/app-qr-code.png)

Open **Camera** app on your iOS device, point to a QR code and click **Open in Flet** link.

A dialog asking for permissions to access your local network will popup:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/getting-started/testing-on-ios/img/docs/getting-started/testing-on-ios/flet-local-network.png)

Click **Allow** and you should see your Flet app running.

Try updating `main.py` (for example, replace a greeting of `Text` control) - the app will be instantly refreshed on your iOS device.

You can try more complex Flet example from [Introduction](/docs/#flet-app-example).

To return to "Home" tab either:

-   Long-press anywhere on the screen with 3 fingers or
-   Shake your iOS device.

You can also "manually" add a new project by clicking **"+"** button and typing its URL.

Quick test

There is "Counter" Flet project hosted on the internet that you can add to Flet app to make sure everything works:

```
https://flet-counter-test-ios.fly.dev
```

Check "Gallery" tab for some great examples of what kind of projects could be done with Flet.

Explore [Flet examples](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/tree/main/python) for even more examples.

# Async apps

Flet app can be written as an async app and use `asyncio` and other Python async libraries. Calling coroutines is naturally supported in Flet, so you don't need to wrap them to run synchronously.

By default, Flet executes control event handlers in separate threads, but sometimes that could be an ineffective usage of CPU or it does nothing while waiting for a HTTP response or executing `sleep()`.

Asyncio, on the other hand, allows implementing concurrency in a single thread by switching execution context between "coroutines". This is especially important for apps that are going to be [published as static websites](/docs/publish/web/static-website) using [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/). Pyodide is a Python runtime built as a WebAssembly (WASM) and running in the browser. At the time of writing it doesn't support [threading](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/issues/237) yet.

## Getting started with async[​](/docs/getting-started/async-apps#getting-started-with-async "Direct link to Getting started with async")

You could mark `main()` method of Flet app as `async` and then use any asyncio API inside it:

```
import flet as ftasync def main(page: ft.Page):    await asyncio.sleep(1)    page.add(ft.Text("Hello, async world!"))ft.app(main)
```

You can use `await ft.app_async(main)` if Flet app is part of a larger app and called from `async` code.

## Control event handlers[​](/docs/getting-started/async-apps#control-event-handlers "Direct link to Control event handlers")

Control event handlers could be both sync and `async`.

If a handler does not call any async methods it could be a regular sync method:

```
def page_resize(e):    print("New page size:", page.window.width, page.window.height)page.on_resize = page_resize
```

However, if a handler calls async logic it must be async too:

```
async def main(page: ft.Page):    async def button_click(e):        await some_async_method()        page.add(ft.Text("Hello!"))    page.add(ft.ElevatedButton("Say hello!", on_click=button_click))ft.app(main)
```

### Async lambdas[​](/docs/getting-started/async-apps#async-lambdas "Direct link to Async lambdas")

There are no async lambdas in Python. It's perfectly fine to have a lambda event handler in async app for simple things:

```
page.on_error = lambda e: print("Page error:", e.data)
```

but you can't have an async lambda, so an async event handler must be used.

## Sleeping[​](/docs/getting-started/async-apps#sleeping "Direct link to Sleeping")

To delay code execution in async Flet app you should use [`asyncio.sleep()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.sleep) instead of `time.sleep()`, for example:

```
import asyncioimport flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    async def button_click(e):        await asyncio.sleep(1)        page.add(ft.Text("Hello!"))    page.add(        ft.ElevatedButton("Say hello with delay!", on_click=button_click)    )ft.app(main)
```

## Threading[​](/docs/getting-started/async-apps#threading "Direct link to Threading")

To run something in the background use [`page.run_task()`](/docs/controls/page#run_taskhandler-args-kwargs). For example, "Countdown" custom control which is self-updating on background could be implemented as following:

```
import asyncioimport flet as ftclass Countdown(ft.Text):    def __init__(self, seconds):        super().__init__()        self.seconds = seconds    def did_mount(self):        self.running = True        self.page.run_task(self.update_timer)    def will_unmount(self):        self.running = False    async def update_timer(self):        while self.seconds and self.running:            mins, secs = divmod(self.seconds, 60)            self.value = "{:02d}:{:02d}".format(mins, secs)            self.update()            await asyncio.sleep(1)            self.seconds -= 1def main(page: ft.Page):    page.add(Countdown(120), Countdown(60))ft.app(main)
```

# Publishing Flet app to multiple platforms

## Introduction[​](/docs/publish#introduction "Direct link to Introduction")

Flet CLI provides `flet build` command that allows packaging Flet app into a standalone executable or install package for distribution.

## Platform matrix[​](/docs/publish#platform-matrix "Direct link to Platform matrix")

The following matrix shows which OS you should run `flet build` command on in order to build a package for specific platform:

Run on / `flet build`

`apk/aab`

`ipa`

`macos`

`linux`

`windows`

`web`

macOS

✅

✅

✅

✅

Windows

✅

✅ (WSL)

✅

✅

Linux

✅

✅

✅

## Prerequisites[​](/docs/publish#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

### Flutter SDK[​](/docs/publish#flutter-sdk "Direct link to Flutter SDK")

If the correct version of the Flutter SDK is not found in the `PATH`, it will be automatically installed during the first run when building a Flet app for any platform.

Flutter SDK is installed into `$HOME/flutter/{version}` directory.

## Project structure[​](/docs/publish#project-structure "Direct link to Project structure")

`flet build` command assumes the following minimal Flet project structure:

```
├── README.md├── pyproject.toml└── src    ├── assets    │   └── icon.png    └── main.py
```

`main.py` is the entry point of your Flet application with `ft.app(main)` at the end. A different entry point could be specified with `--module-name` argument.

`assets` is an optional directory that contains application assets (images, sound, text and other files required by your app) as well as images used for package icons and splash screens.

If only `icon.png` (or other supported format such as `.bmp`, `.jpg`, `.webp`) is provided it will be used as a source image to generate all icons and splash screens for all platforms. See section below for more information about icons and splashes.

`pyproject.toml` contains the application metadata, lists its dependencies and controls build process. The list of project dependencies should contain at least `flet` package:

pyproject.toml

```
[project]name = "myapp"version = "0.1.0"description = ""readme = "README.md"requires-python = ">=3.9"authors = [    { name = "Flet developer", email = "you@example.com" }]dependencies = [  "flet"][tool.flet]org = "com.mycompany"product = "MyApp"company = "My Company"copyright = "Copyright (C) 2025 by My Company"[tool.flet.app]path = "src"
```

note

Though `requirements.txt` can also be used to list app requirements Flet recommends using `pyproject.toml` for new projects. If both `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt` exist the latter will be ignored.

No pip freeze

Do not use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` command to create `requirements.txt` for the app that will be running on mobile. As you run `pip freeze` command on a desktop `requirements.txt` will have dependencies that are not intended to work on a mobile device, such as `watchdog`.

Hand-pick `requirements.txt` to have only direct dependencies required by your app, plus `flet`.

The easiest way to start with the right project structure is to use `flet create` command:

```
flet create myapp
```

where `myapp` is a target directory.

## How it works[​](/docs/publish#how-it-works "Direct link to How it works")

`flet build <target_platform>` command could be run from the root of Flet app directory:

```
<flet_app_directory> % flet build <target_platform>
```

where `<target_platform>` could be one of the following: `apk`, `aab`, `ipa`, `web`, `macos`, `windows`, `linux`.

When running from a different directory you can provide the path to a directory with Flet app:

```
flet build <target_platform> <path_to_python_app>
```

Build results are copied to `<python_app_directory>/build/<target_platform>`. You can specify a custom output directory with `--output` option:

```
flet build <target_platform> --output <path-to-output-dir>
```

`flet build` uses Flutter SDK and the number of Flutter packages to build a distribution package from your Flet app.

When you run `flet build <target_platform>` command it:

-   Creates a new Flutter project in `{flet_app_directory}/build/flutter` directory from [https://github.com/flet-dev/flet-build-template](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet-build-template) template. Flutter app will contain a packaged Python app in the assets and use `flet` and `serious_python` packages to run Python app and render its UI respectively. The project is ephemeral and deleted upon completion.
-   Copies custom icons and splash images (see below) from `assets` directory into a Flutter project.
-   Generates icons for all platforms using [`flutter_launcher_icons`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_launcher_icons) package.
-   Generates splash screens for web, iOS and Android targets using [`flutter_native_splash`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_native_splash) package.
-   Packages Python app using `package` command of [`serious_python`](https://pub.dev/packages/serious_python) package. `package` command installs pure and binary Python packages from [https://pypi.org](https://pypi.org) and [https://pypi.flet.dev](https://pypi.flet.dev) for selected platform. If configured, `.py` files of installed packages and/or application will be compiled to `.pyc` files. All files, except `build` directory will be added to a package asset.
-   Runs `flutter build <target_platform>` command to produce an executable or an install package.
-   Copies build results to `{flet_app_directory}/build/<target_platform>` directory.

## Including optional controls[​](/docs/publish#including-optional-controls "Direct link to Including optional controls")

If your app uses the following controls their packages must be added to a build command:

-   Ad controls (`BannerAd` and `InterstitialAd`) implemented in `flet_ads` package.
-   [`Audio`](/docs/controls/audio) control implemented in `flet_audio` package.
-   [`AudioRecorder`](/docs/controls/audiorecorder) control implemented in `flet_audio_recorder` package.
-   [`Flashlight`](/docs/controls/flashlight) control implemented in `flet_flashlight` package.
-   [`Geolocator`](/docs/controls/geolocator) control implemented in `flet_geolocator` package.
-   [`Lottie`](/docs/controls/lottie) control implemented in `flet_lottie` package.
-   [`Map`](/docs/controls/map) control implemented in `flet_map` package.
-   [`PermissionHandler`](/docs/controls/permissionhandler) control implemented in `flet_permission_handler` package.
-   [`Rive`](/docs/controls/rive) control implemented in `flet_rive` package.
-   [`Video`](/docs/controls/video) control implemented in `flet_video` package.
-   [`WebView`](/docs/controls/webview) control implemented in `flet_webview` package.

Use `--include-packages <package_1> <package_2> ...` option to add Flutter packages with optional Flet controls or use `tool.flet.flutter.dependencies` section in `pyproject.toml`.

For example, to build your Flet app with `Video` and `Audio` controls add `--include-packages flet_video flet_audio` to your `flet build` command:

```
flet build apk --include-packages flet_video flet_audio
```

or the same in `pyproject.toml`:

```
flutter.dependencies = ["flet_video", "flet_audio"]
```

or an alternative syntax with versions:

```
[tool.flet.flutter.dependencies]flet_video = "1.0.0"flet_audio = "2.0.0"
```

or with path to the package on your disk:

```
[tool.flet.flutter.dependencies.my_package]path = "/path/to/my_package"
```

## Icons[​](/docs/publish#icons "Direct link to Icons")

You can customize app icons for all platforms (excluding Linux) with images in `assets` directory of your Flet app.

If only `icon.png` (or other supported format such as `.bmp`, `.jpg`, `.webp`) is provided it will be used as a source image to generate all icons.

-   **iOS** - `icon_ios.png` (or any supported image format). Recommended minimum image size is 1024 px. Image should not be transparent (have alpha channel). Defaults to `icon.png` with alpha-channel automatically removed.
-   **Android** - `icon_android.png` (or any supported image format). Recommended minimum image size is 192 px. Defaults to `icon.png`.
-   **Web** - `icon_web.png` (or any supported image format). Recommended minimum image size is 512 px. Defaults to `icon.png`.
-   **Windows** - `icon_windows.png` (or any supported image format). ICO will be produced of 256 px size. Defaults to `icon.png`. If `icon_windows.ico` file is provided it will be just copied to `windows/runner/resources/app_icon.ico` unmodified.
-   **macOS** - `icon_macos.png` (or any supported image format). Recommended minimum image size is 1024 px. Defaults to `icon.png`.

## Splash screen[​](/docs/publish#splash-screen "Direct link to Splash screen")

You can customize splash screens for iOS, Android and web applications with images in `assets` directory of your Flet app.

If only `splash.png` or `icon.png` (or other supported format such as `.bmp`, `.jpg`, `.webp`) is provided it will be used as a source image to generate all splash screen.

-   **iOS (light)** - `splash_ios.png` (or any supported image format). Defaults to `splash.png` and then `icon.png`.
-   **iOS (dark)** - `splash_dark_ios.png` (or any supported image format). Defaults to light iOS splash, then to `splash_dark.png`, then to `splash.png` and then `icon.png`.
-   **Android (light)** - `splash_android.png` (or any supported image format). Defaults to `splash.png` and then `icon.png`.
-   **Android (dark)** - `splash_dark_android.png` (or any supported image format). Defaults to light Android splash, then to `splash_dark.png`, then to `splash.png` and then `icon.png`.
-   **Web (light)** - `splash_web.png` (or any supported image format). Defaults to `splash.png` and then `icon.png`.
-   **Web (dark)** - `splash_dark_web.png` (or any supported image format). Defaults to light web splash, then `splash_dark.png`, then to `splash.png` and then `icon.png`.

`--splash-color` option specifies background color for a splash screen in light mode. Defaults to `#ffffff`.

`--splash-dark-color` option specifies background color for a splash screen in dark mode. Defaults to `#333333`.

Configuring splash settings in `pyproject.toml`:

```
[tool.flet.splash]color = "#FFFF00" # --splash-colordark_color = "#8B8000" # --splash-dark-colorweb = false # --no-web-splashios = false # --no-ios-splashandroid = false # --no-android-splash
```

## Entry point[​](/docs/publish#entry-point "Direct link to Entry point")

By default, `flet build` command assumes `main.py` as the entry point of your Flet application, i.e. the file with `ft.app(main)` at the end. A different entry point could be specified with `--module-name` argument or in `pyproject.toml`:

```
[tool.flet]app.module = "main"
```

## Compilation and cleanup[​](/docs/publish#compilation-and-cleanup "Direct link to Compilation and cleanup")

`flet build` command is not compiling app `.py` files into `.pyc` by default which allows you to avoid (or defer?) discovery of any syntax errors in your app and successfully complete the packaging.

You can enable the compilation and cleanup with the following new options:

-   `--compile-app` - compile app's `.py` files.
-   `--compile-packages` - compile installed packages' `.py` files.
-   `--cleanup-on-compile` - remove unnecessary files upon successful compilation.

Configuring compilation in `pyproject.toml`:

```
[tool.flet]compile.app = true # --compile-appcompile.packages = true # --compile-packagescompile.cleanup = true # --cleanup-on-compile
```

## Permissions[​](/docs/publish#permissions "Direct link to Permissions")

`flet build` command allows granular control over permissions, features and entitlements embedded into `AndroidManifest.xml`, `Info.plist` and `.entitlements` files.

See platform guides for setting specific [iOS](/docs/publish/ios), [Android](/docs/publish/android) and [macOS](/docs/publish/macos) permissions.

### Cross-platform permissions[​](/docs/publish#cross-platform-permissions "Direct link to Cross-platform permissions")

There are pre-defined permissions that mapped to `Info.plist`, `*.entitlements` and `AndroidManifest.xml` for respective platforms.

Setting cross-platform permissions:

```
flet build --permissions permission_1 permission_2 ...
```

Supported permissions:

-   `location`
-   `camera`
-   `microphone`
-   `photo_library`

#### iOS mapping to `Info.plist` entries[​](/docs/publish#ios-mapping-to-infoplist-entries "Direct link to ios-mapping-to-infoplist-entries")

-   `location`
    -   `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription = This app uses location service when in use.`
    -   `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription = This app uses location service.`
-   `camera`
    -   `NSCameraUsageDescription = This app uses the camera to capture photos and videos.`
-   `microphone`
    -   `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription = This app uses microphone to record sounds.`
-   `photo_library`
    -   `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription = This app saves photos and videos to the photo library.`

#### macOS mapping to entitlements[​](/docs/publish#macos-mapping-to-entitlements "Direct link to macOS mapping to entitlements")

-   `location`
    -   `com.apple.security.personal-information.location = True`
-   `camera`
    -   `com.apple.security.device.camera = True`
-   `microphone`
    -   `com.apple.security.device.audio-input = True`
-   `photo_library`
    -   `com.apple.security.personal-information.photos-library = True`

#### Android mappings[​](/docs/publish#android-mappings "Direct link to Android mappings")

-   `location`
    -   permissions:
        -   `android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION": True`
        -   `android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION": True`
        -   `android.permission.ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION": True`
    -   features:
        -   `android.hardware.location.network": False`
        -   `android.hardware.location.gps": False`
-   `camera`
    -   permissions:
        -   `android.permission.CAMERA": True`
    -   features:
        -   `android.hardware.camera": False`
        -   `android.hardware.camera.any": False`
        -   `android.hardware.camera.front": False`

        -   `android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE": True`
        -   `android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE": True`
-   `photo_library`
    -   permissions:
        -   `android.permission.READ_MEDIA_VISUAL_USER_SELECTED": True`

Configuring cross-platform permissions in `pyproject.toml`:

```
[tool.flet]permissions = ["camera", "microphone"]
```

## Versioning[​](/docs/publish#versioning "Direct link to Versioning")

You can provide a version information for built executable or package with `--build-number` and `--build-version` arguments. This is the information that is used to distinguish one build/release from another in App Store and Google Play and is shown to the user in about dialogs.

`--build-number` - an integer number (defaults to `1`), an identifier used as an internal version number. Each build must have a unique identifier to differentiate it from previous builds. It is used to determine whether one build is more recent than another, with higher numbers indicating more recent build.

`--build-version` - a "x.y.z" string (defaults to `1.0.0`) used as the version number shown to users. For each new version of your app, you will provide a version number to differentiate it from previous versions.

Configuring display version and version number in `pyproject.toml`:

```
[project]name = "my_app"version = "1.0.0"description = "My Flet app"authors = [  {name = "John Smith", email = "john@email.com"}]dependencies = ["flet==0.25.0"][tool.flet]build_number = 1
```

## Customizing packaging template[​](/docs/publish#customizing-packaging-template "Direct link to Customizing packaging template")

To create a temporary Flutter project `flet build` uses [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) template stored in [https://github.com/flet-dev/flet-build-template](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet-build-template) repository.

You can customize that template to suit your specific needs and then use it with `flet build`.

`--template` option can be used to provide the URL to the repository or path to a directory with your own template. Use `gh:` prefix for GitHub repos, e.g. `gh:{my-org}/{my-repo}` or provide a full path to a Git repository, e.g. `https://github.com/{my-org}/{my-repo}.git`.

For Git repositories you can checkout specific branch/tag/commit with `--template-ref` option.

`--template-dir` option specifies a relative path to a cookiecutter template in a repository given by `--template` option. When `--template` option is not used, this option specifies path relative to the `<user-directory>/.cookiecutters/flet-build-template`.

Configuring template in `pyproject.toml`:

```
[tool.flet.template]path = "gh:some-github/repo" # --templatedir = "" # --template-dirref = "" # --template-ref
```

## Extra args to `flutter build` command[​](/docs/publish#extra-args-to-flutter-build-command "Direct link to extra-args-to-flutter-build-command")

`--flutter-build-args` option allows passing extra arguments to `flutter build` command called during the build process. The option can be used multiple times.

For example, if you want to add `--no-tree-shake-icons` option:

```
flet build macos --flutter-build-args=--no-tree-shake-icons
```

To pass an option with a value:

```
flet build ipa --flutter-build-args=--export-method --flutter-build-args=development
```

Configuring Flutter build extra args:

```
[tool.flet]flutter.build_args = [    "--some-flutter-arg-1",    "--some-flutter-arg-2"]
```

## Verbose logging[​](/docs/publish#verbose-logging "Direct link to Verbose logging")

`--verbose` or `-vv` option allows to see the output of all commands during `flet build` run. We might ask for a detailed log if you need support.

## Console output[​](/docs/publish#console-output "Direct link to Console output")

All Flet apps output to `stdout` and `stderr` (e.g. all `print()` statements or `sys.stdout.write()` calls, Python `logging` library) is now redirected to `console.log` file with a full path to it stored in `FLET_APP_CONSOLE` environment variable.

Writes to that file are unbuffered, so you can retrieve a log in your Python program at any moment with a simple:

```
with open(os.getenv("FLET_APP_CONSOLE"), "r") as f:    log = f.read()
```

`AlertDialog` or any other control can be used to display the value of `log` variable.

When the program is terminated by calling `sys.exit()` with exit code `100` (magic code) the entire log will be displayed in a scrollable window.

```
import syssys.exit(100)
```

Calling `sys.exit()` with any other exit code will terminate (close) the app without displaying a log.

# Packaging app for Android

## Introduction[​](/docs/publish/android#introduction "Direct link to Introduction")

Flet CLI provides `flet build apk` and `flet build aab` commands that allow packaging Flet app into Android APK and Android App Bundle (AAB) respectively.

## Prerequisites[​](/docs/publish/android#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

### Android SDK[​](/docs/publish/android#android-sdk "Direct link to Android SDK")

Java (JDK) and Android SDK will be automatically installed on the first run of `flet build` command.

JDK is installed into `$HOME/java/{version}` directory.

If you have Android Studio installed Flet CLI will locate and use Android SDK coming with the studio; otherwise Android SDK will be installed to `$HOME/Android/sdk` directory.

### Android wheels for binary Python packages[​](/docs/publish/android#android-wheels-for-binary-python-packages "Direct link to Android wheels for binary Python packages")

Binary Python packages (vs "pure" Python packages written in Python only) are packages that partially written in C, Rust or other languages producing native code. Example packages are `numpy`, `cryptography`, or `pydantic-core`.

Make sure all non-pure (binary) packages used in your Flet app have [pre-built wheels for Android](/docs/reference/binary-packages-android-ios).

## `flet build apk`[​](/docs/publish/android#flet-build-apk "Direct link to flet-build-apk")

Build an Android APK file from your app.

This command builds release version. 'release' builds don't support debugging and are suitable for deploying to app stores. If you are deploying the app to the Play Store, it's recommended to use Android App Bundles (AAB) or split the APK to reduce the APK size.

-   [https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle](https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle)
-   [https://developer.android.com/studio/build/configure-apk-splits#configure-abi-split](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/configure-apk-splits#configure-abi-split)

### Building platform-specific APKs[​](/docs/publish/android#building-platform-specific-apks "Direct link to Building platform-specific APKs")

By default, Flet builds "fat" APK which includes binaries for both `arm64-v8a` and `armeabi-v7a` architectures.

You can configure Flet to split fat APK into smaller APKs for each platformby using `--split-per-abi` option or by setting `split_per_abi` in `pyproject.toml`:

```
[tool.flet.android]split_per_abi = true
```

### Installing APK to a device[​](/docs/publish/android#installing-apk-to-a-device "Direct link to Installing APK to a device")

The easiest way to install APK to your device is to use `adb` (Android Debug Bridge) tool.

`adb` is a part of Android SDK. For example, on macOS, if Android SDK was installed with Android Studio the location of `adb` tool will be at `~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb`.

[Check this article](https://www.makeuseof.com/install-apps-via-adb-android/) for more information about installing and using `adb` tool on various platforms.

To install APK to a device run the following command:

```
adb install <path-to-your.apk>
```

If more than one device is connected to your computer (say, emulator and a physical phone) you can use `-s` option to specify which device you want to install `.apk` on:

```
adb -s <device> install <path-to-your.apk>
```

where `<device>` can be found with `adb devices` command.

## `flet build aab`[​](/docs/publish/android#flet-build-aab "Direct link to flet-build-aab")

Build an Android App Bundle (AAB) file from your app.

This command builds release version. 'release' builds don't support debugging and are suitable for deploying to app stores. App bundle is the recommended way to publish to the Play Store as it improves your app size.

## Signing Android bundle[​](/docs/publish/android#signing-android-bundle "Direct link to Signing Android bundle")

TBD

```
[tool.flet.android.signing]# store and key passwords can be passed with `--android-signing-key-store-password`# and `--android-signing-key-password` options or# FLET_ANDROID_SIGNING_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD# and FLET_ANDROID_SIGNING_KEY_PASSWORD environment variables.key_store = "path/to/store.jks" # --android-signing-key-storekey_alias = "upload"
```

## Splash screen[​](/docs/publish/android#splash-screen "Direct link to Splash screen")

By default, generated Android app will be showing a splash screen with an image from `assets` directory (see below) or Flet logo. You can disable splash screen for Android app with `--no-android-splash` option.

Configuring splash in `pyproject.toml`:

```
[tool.flet.splash]android = false
```

## Permissions[​](/docs/publish/android#permissions "Direct link to Permissions")

Configuring Android permissions and features to be written into `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```
flet build --android-permissions permission=True|False ... --android-features feature_name=True|False
```

For example:

```
flet build \    --android-permissions android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE=True \      android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE=True \    --android-features android.hardware.location.network=False
```

Default Android permissions:

-   `android.permission.INTERNET`

Default permissions can be disabled with `--android-permissions` option and `False` value, for example:

```
flet build --android-permissions android.permission.INTERNET=False
```

Default Android features:

-   `android.software.leanback=False` (`False` means it's written in manifest as `android:required="false"`)
-   `android.hardware.touchscreen=False`

Configuring permissions and features in `pyproject.toml` (notice quotes `"` around key names):

```
[tool.flet.android.permission] # --android-permissions"android.permission.CAMERA" = true"android.permission.CAMERA" = true[tool.flet.android.feature] # --android-features"android.hardware.camera" = false
```

## Meta-data[​](/docs/publish/android#meta-data "Direct link to Meta-data")

Configuring Android app meta-data to be written into `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```
flet build --android-meta-data name_1=value_1 name_2=value_2 ...
```

Default Android meta-data:

-   `io.flutter.embedding.android.EnableImpeller=false`

Configuring meta-data in `pyproject.toml` (notice quotes `"` around key names):

```
[tool.flet.android.meta_data]"com.google.android.gms.ads.APPLICATION_ID" = "ca-app-pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx~yyyyyyyyyy"
```

## Deep linking[​](/docs/publish/android#deep-linking "Direct link to Deep linking")

You can configure deep-linking settings for Android app with the following `flet build` options:

-   `--deep-linking-scheme` - deep linking URL scheme to configure for Android builds, i.g. "https" or "myapp".
-   `--deep-linking-host` - deep linking URL host.

The same can be configured in `pyproject.toml`:

```

# Packaging app for iOS

## Introduction[​](/docs/publish/ios#introduction "Direct link to Introduction")

Flet CLI provides `flet build ipa` command that allows packaging Flet app into an iOS archive bundle and IPA for distribution.

note

The command can be run on macOS only.

## Prerequisites[​](/docs/publish/ios#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

### Rosetta 2[​](/docs/publish/ios#rosetta-2 "Direct link to Rosetta 2")

Flutter requires [Rosetta 2](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861) on Apple silicon:

```
sudo softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license
```

### Xcode[​](/docs/publish/ios#xcode "Direct link to Xcode")

[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) 15 or later to compile native Swift or ObjectiveC code.

### CocoaPods[​](/docs/publish/ios#cocoapods "Direct link to CocoaPods")

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) 1.16 to compile and enable Flutter plugins.

### iOS wheels for binary Python packages[​](/docs/publish/ios#ios-wheels-for-binary-python-packages "Direct link to iOS wheels for binary Python packages")

Binary Python packages (vs "pure" Python packages written in Python only) are packages that partially written in C, Rust or other languages producing native code. Example packages are `numpy`, `cryptography`, or `pydantic-core`.

Make sure all non-pure (binary) packages used in your Flet app have [pre-built wheels for iOS](/docs/reference/binary-packages-android-ios).

## `flet build ipa`[​](/docs/publish/ios#flet-build-ipa "Direct link to flet-build-ipa")

Build an iOS archive bundle and IPA for distribution (macOS host only).

To successfully generate "runnable" IPA you should provide correct values for the following arguments:

-   `--org` - organization name in reverse domain name notation, e.g. `com.mycompany` (defaults to `com.flet`). The value is combined with `--project` and used as an iOS and Android bundle ID.
-   `--project` - project name in C-style identifier format (lowercase alphanumerics with underscores) used to build bundle ID and as a name for bundle executable. By default, it's the name of Flet app directory.
-   `--team` - team ID to locate provisioning profile. If no team ID provided a unsigned iOS archive will be generated.

You can also configure these settings in `pyproject.toml`:

```
[project]name = "my-app"[tool.flet]org = "com.mycompany"[tool.flet.ios]team = "team_id"
```

## Permissions[​](/docs/publish/ios#permissions "Direct link to Permissions")

Setting iOS permissions which are written into `Info.plist` file:

```
flet build --info-plist permission_1=True|False|description permission_2=True|False|description ...
```

For example:

```
flet build --info-plist NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription="This app uses location service when in use."
```

Configuring iOS permissions in `pyproject.toml`:

```
[tool.flet.ios.info] # --info-plistNSCameraUsageDescription = "This app uses the camera to ..."
```

## Deep linking[​](/docs/publish/ios#deep-linking "Direct link to Deep linking")

You can configure deep-linking settings for iOS bundle with the following `flet build` options:

-   `--deep-linking-scheme` - deep linking URL scheme to configure for iOS and Android builds, i.g. "https" or "myapp".
-   `--deep-linking-host` - deep linking URL host.

The same can be configured in `pyproject.toml`:

```
[tool.flet.ios.deep_linking]scheme = "https"host = "mydomain.com"
```

See [Deep linking](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/navigation/deep-linking) section in Flutter docs for more information and complete setup guide.

# Packaging app for macOS

Flet CLI provides `flet build macos` command that allows packaging Flet app into a macOS application bundle.

note

The command can be run on macOS only.

## Prerequisites[​](/docs/publish/macos#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

## Prerequisites[​](/docs/publish/macos#prerequisites-1 "Direct link to Prerequisites")

### Rosetta 2[​](/docs/publish/macos#rosetta-2 "Direct link to Rosetta 2")

Flutter requires [Rosetta 2](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861) on Apple silicon:

```
sudo softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license
```

### Xcode[​](/docs/publish/macos#xcode "Direct link to Xcode")

### CocoaPods[​](/docs/publish/macos#cocoapods "Direct link to CocoaPods")

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) 1.16 to compile and enable Flutter plugins.

## `flet build macos`[​](/docs/publish/macos#flet-build-macos "Direct link to flet-build-macos")

Creates a macOS application bundle from your Flet app.

## Bundle architecture[​](/docs/publish/macos#bundle-architecture "Direct link to Bundle architecture")

By default, `flet build macos` command builds universal app bundle that works on both Apple Silicon and older Intel processors. Therefore, packaging utility will try to download Python binary wheels for both `arm64` and `x86_64` platforms. Recent releases of some popular packages do not include `x86_64` wheels anymore, so the entire packaging operation will fail.

You can limit the build command to a specific architecture only, by using `--arch` option. For example, to build macOS app bundle that works on Apple Silicon only use the following command:

```
flet build macos --arch arm64
```

The same can be configured in `pyproject.toml`:

```
[tool.flet.macos]build_arch = "arm64"
```

## Permissions[​](/docs/publish/macos#permissions "Direct link to Permissions")

Setting macOS entitlements which are written and `.entitlements` files:

```
flet build --macos-entitlements name_1=True|False name_2=True|False ...
```

Default macOS entitlements:

-   `com.apple.security.app-sandbox = False`
-   `com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit = True`
-   `com.apple.security.network.client = True`
-   `com.apple.security.network.server" = True`

Configuring macOS app entitlements in `pyproject.toml` (notice `"` around entitlement name):

```
[tool.flet.macos]entitlement."com.apple.security.personal-information.photos-library" = true
```

```

See [this guide](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/installing/on-linux.html?gi-language=c) for installing on other Linux distributives.

To build your Flet app that uses `Audio` control add `--include-packages flet_audio` to `flet build` command, for example:

```
flet build apk --include-packages flet_audio
```

### MPV for `Video`[​](/docs/publish/linux#mpv-for-video "Direct link to mpv-for-video")

[libmpv](https://mpv.io/) libraries must be installed if your Flet app uses `Video` control. On Ubuntu/Debian you can install it with:

```
sudo apt install libmpv-dev mpv
```

To build your Flet app that uses `Video` control add `--include-packages flet_video` to `flet build` command, for example:

```
flet build apk --include-packages flet_video
```

# Publishing Flet app to web

Flet allows publishing your app as a **static** or **dynamic** website.

**Static website** - content is not changing and delivered exactly as it's stored. Python code is running in the web browser.

**Dynamic website** - content is dynamically generated for each user. Python code is running on the server.

Here is a table comparing Flet app running as a static vs dynamic website:

[Static website](/docs/publish/web/static-website)

[Dynamic website](/docs/publish/web/dynamic-website)

**Loading time**

⬇️ Slower - Python runtime (Pyodide) along with app's Python code and all its dependencies must be loaded into the browser. Pyodide initialization takes time too.

✅ Faster - the app stays and runs on the server.

**Python compatibility**

⬇️ Not every program that works with native Python [can be run with Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/wasm-constraints.html)

✅ Any Python package can be used.

**Responsiveness**

✅ Zero latency between user-generated events (clicks, text field changes, drags) and page updates.

⬇️ Non-zero latency - user-generated events are communicated to a server via WebSockets. UI updates are communicated back.

**Performance**

⬇️ Slower - Pyodide is currently 3x-5x slower than native Python because of WASM

✅ Faster - the code is running on the server by native Python.

**Code protection**

⬇️ Low - app's code is loaded into a web browser and can be inspected by a user.

✅ High - the app is running on the server.

**Hosting**

✅ Cheap/Free - no code is running on the server and thus the app can be hosted anywhere: GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, Replit, Vercel, a shared hosting or your own VPS.

⬇️ Paid - the app requires Python code to run on the server and communicate with a web browser via WebSockets.

# Creating Flet extension for existing Flutter package

## Introduction[​](/docs/extend/user-extensions#introduction "Direct link to Introduction")

While Flet controls leverage many built-in Flutter widgets, enabling the creation of complex applications, not all Flutter widgets or third-party packages can be directly supported by the Flet team or included within the core Flet framework.

To address this, the Flet framework provides an extensibility mechanism. This allows you to incorporate widgets and APIs from your own custom Flutter packages or [third-party libraries](https://pub.dev/packages?sort=popularity) directly into your Flet application.

In this guide, you will learn how to create Flet extension from template and then customize it to integrate 3rd-party Flutter package into your Flet app.

### Prerequisites[​](/docs/extend/user-extensions#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

To integrate custom Flutter package into Flet you need to have basic understanding of how to create Flutter apps and packages in Dart language and have Flutter development environment configured. See [Flutter Getting Started](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) for more information about Flutter and Dart.

## Create Flet extension from template[​](/docs/extend/user-extensions#create-flet-extension-from-template "Direct link to Create Flet extension from template")

Flet now makes it easy to create and build projects with your custom controls based on Flutter widgets or Flutter 3rd-party packages. In the example below, we will be creating a custom Flet extension based on the [flutter\_spinkit](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_spinkit) package.

1.  Create new virtual enviroment and [install Flet](/docs/getting-started/#python-venv-module) there.
    
2.  Create new Flet extension project from template:
    

```
flet create --template extension --project-name flet-spinkit
```

A project with new FletSpinkit control will be created. The control is just a Flutter Text widget with text property, which we will customize later.

3.  Build your app.

Flet project created from extension template has `examples/flet_spinkit_example` folder with the example app.

When in the folder where your `pyproject.toml` for the app is (`examples/flet_spinkit_example`), run `flet build` command, for example, for macos:

```
flet build macos -v
```

Open the app and see the new custom Flet Control:

```
open build/macos/flet-spinkit-example.app
```

![](https://flet.dev/docs/extend/user-extensions/img/docs/extending-flet/example.png)

4.  Change your app.

Once the project was built for desktop once, you can make changes to your python files and run it without re-building.

First, install dependencies from pyproject.toml:

```
pip install .
```

Now you can make changes to your example app main.py:

```
import flet as ftfrom flet_spinkit import FletSpinkitdef main(page: ft.Page):    page.vertical_alignment = ft.MainAxisAlignment.CENTER    page.horizontal_alignment = ft.CrossAxisAlignment.CENTER    page.add(        ft.Container(            height=150,            width=300,            alignment=ft.alignment.center,            bgcolor=ft.Colors.PINK_200,            content=FletSpinkit(                tooltip="My new PINK FletSpinkit Control tooltip",                value="My new PINK FletSpinkit Flet Control",            ),        ),    )ft.app(main)
```

and run:

```
flet run
```

![](https://flet.dev/docs/extend/user-extensions/img/docs/extending-flet/example-pink.png)

5.  Re-build your app.

Known issue

There is a [known issue](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet/issues/4754) that Flet would build with cached files and your changes will not be included. As a temporary solution, you need to clear cache before re-building:

```
pip cache purge
```

When you make any changes to your package, you need to re-build:

```
pip cache purgeflet build macos -v
```

If you need to debug, run this command:

```
build/macos/flet-spinkit-example.app/Contents/MacOS/flet-spinkit-example --debug
```

## Integrate 3rd-party Flutter package[​](/docs/extend/user-extensions#integrate-3rd-party-flutter-package "Direct link to Integrate 3rd-party Flutter package")

For the example purposes we will be integrating [flutter\_spinkit](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_spinkit) package into our Flet app.

1.  Add dependency.

Go to `src/flutter/flet_spinkit` folder and run this command to add dependency to `flutter_spinkit` to `pubspec.yaml`:

```
flutter pub add flutter_spinkit
```

Read more information about using Flutter packages [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/using-packages).

2.  Modify `dart` file.

In the `src/flutter/flet_spinkit/lib/src/flet_spinkit.dart` file, add import statement and replace Text widget with `SpinKitRotatingCircle` widget:

```
import 'package:flet/flet.dart';import 'package:flutter/material.dart';import 'package:flutter_spinkit/flutter_spinkit.dart';class FletSpinkitControl extends StatelessWidget {  final Control? parent;  final Control control;  const FletSpinkitControl({    super.key,    required this.parent,    required this.control,  });  @override  Widget build(BuildContext context) {    Widget myControl = SpinKitRotatingCircle(      color: Colors.red,      size: 100.0,    );    return constrainedControl(context, myControl, parent, control);  }}
```

3.  Rebuild your example app.

Go to `examples/flet_spinkit_example`, clear cache and rebuild your app:

```
pip cache purgeflet build macos -v
```

4.  Run your app:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/extend/user-extensions/img/docs/extending-flet/spinkit1.gif)

## Flet extension structure[​](/docs/extend/user-extensions#flet-extension-structure "Direct link to Flet extension structure")

After creating new Flet project from extension template, you will see the following folder structure:

```
├── LICENSE├── README.md├── examples│   └── flet_spinkit_example│       ├── README.md│       ├── pyproject.toml│       └── src│           └── main.py├── pyproject.toml└── src    ├── flet_spinkit    │   ├── __init__.py    │   └── flet_spinkit.py    └── flutter        └── flet_spinkit            ├── CHANGELOG.md            ├── LICENSE            ├── README.md            ├── lib            │   ├── flet_spinkit.dart            │   └── src            │       ├── create_control.dart            │       └── flet_spinkit.dart            └── pubspec.yaml
```

Flet extension consists of:

-   **package**, located in `src` folder
-   **example app**, located in `examples/flet-spinkit_example` folder

### Package[​](/docs/extend/user-extensions#package "Direct link to Package")

Package is the component that will be used in your app. It contists of two parts: Python and Flutter.

#### Python[​](/docs/extend/user-extensions#python "Direct link to Python")

##### flet\_spinkit.py[​](/docs/extend/user-extensions#flet_spinkitpy "Direct link to flet_spinkit.py")

Here you create Flet Python control - a Python class that you use in your Flet app.

The minumal requirements for this class is that it has to be inherited from Flet `Control` and it has to have `_get_control_name` method that will return the control name. This name should be the same as `args.control.type` we check in the `create_control.dart` file.

#### Flutter[​](/docs/extend/user-extensions#flutter "Direct link to Flutter")

##### pubspec.yaml[​](/docs/extend/user-extensions#pubspecyaml "Direct link to pubspec.yaml")

A yaml file containing metadata that specifies the package's dependencies.

There is already a dependency to `flet` created from template. You need to add there a dependency to Flutter package for which you are creating your extension.

##### flet\_spinkit.dart[​](/docs/extend/user-extensions#flet_spinkitdart "Direct link to flet_spinkit.dart")

Two methods are exported:

-   `createControl` - called to create a widget that corresponds to a control on Python side.
-   `ensureInitialized` - called once on Flet program start.

##### src/create\_control.dart[​](/docs/extend/user-extensions#srccreate_controldart "Direct link to src/create_control.dart")

Creates Flutter widget based on control names returned by the Control's `_get_control_name()` function. This mechanism iterates through all third-party packages and returns the first matching widget.

##### src/flet\_spinkit.dart[​](/docs/extend/user-extensions#srcflet_spinkitdart "Direct link to src/flet_spinkit.dart")

Here you create Flutter "wrapper" widget that will build Flutter widget or API that you want to use in your Flet app.

Wrapper widget passes the state of Python control down to a Flutter widget, that will be displayed on a page, and provides an API to route events from Flutter widget back to Python control.

### Example app[​](/docs/extend/user-extensions#example-app "Direct link to Example app")

##### src/main.py[​](/docs/extend/user-extensions#srcmainpy "Direct link to src/main.py")

Python program that uses Flet Python control.

##### pyproject.toml[​](/docs/extend/user-extensions#pyprojecttoml "Direct link to pyproject.toml")

Here you specify dependency to your package, which can be:

-   **Path dependency**

Absolute path to your Flet extension folder, for example:

```
dependencies = [  "flet-spinkit @ file:///Users/user-name/projects/flet-spinkit",  "flet>=0.26.0",]
```

-   **Git dependency**

Link to git repository, for example:

```
dependencies = [  "flet-ads @ git+https://github.com/flet-dev/flet-ads.git",  "flet>=0.26.0",]
```

-   **PyPi dependency**

Name of the package published on pypi.org, for example:

```
dependencies = [  "flet-ads",  "flet>=0.26.0",]
```

## Customize properties[​](/docs/extend/user-extensions#customize-properties "Direct link to Customize properties")

In the example above, Spinkit control creates a hardcoded Flutter widget. Now let's customize its properties.

### Common properties[​](/docs/extend/user-extensions#common-properties "Direct link to Common properties")

Generally, there are two types of controls in Flet:

1.  Visual controls that are added to the app/page surface, such as FletSpinkit.
    
2.  Non-visual controls that can be:
    
    -   popup controls (dialogs, pickers, panels etc.).
        
    -   services that are added to `overlay`, such as Video or Audio.
        

Flet `Control` class has properties common for all controls such as `visible`, `opacity` and `tooltip`, to name a few.

Flet `ConstrainedControl` class is inherited from `Control` and has many additional properties such as `top` and `left` for its position within Stack and a bunch of animation properties.

When creating non-visual control, your Python control should be inherited from ['Control](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet/blob/main/sdk/python/packages/flet/src/flet/core/control.py). Then, to be able to use `Control` properties in your app, you need to add them to the constructor of your Python Control. In its dart counterpart (`src/flet_spinkit.dart`) use `baseControl()` to wrap your Flutter widget.

When creating visual control, your Python control should be inherited from [`ConstrainedControl`](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet/blob/main/sdk/python/packages/flet/src/flet/core/constrained_control.py). In its dart counterpart (`src/flet_spinkit.dart`) use `constrainedControl()` to wrap your Flutter widget.

Then, to be able to use `Control` and `ConstrainedControl` properties in your app, you need to add them to the constructor of your Python Control.

See reference for the common Control properties [here](https://flet.dev/docs/controls).

If you have created your extension project from Flet extension template, your Python Control is already inherited from `ConstrainedControl` and you can use its properties in your example app:

```
import flet as ftfrom flet_spinkit import FletSpinkitdef main(page: ft.Page):    page.vertical_alignment = ft.MainAxisAlignment.CENTER    page.horizontal_alignment = ft.CrossAxisAlignment.CENTER    page.add(        ft.Stack(            [                ft.Container(height=200, width=200, bgcolor=ft.Colors.BLUE_100),                FletSpinkit(opacity=0.5, tooltip="Spinkit tooltip", top=0, left=0),            ]        )    )ft.app(main)
```

### Control-specific properties[​](/docs/extend/user-extensions#control-specific-properties "Direct link to Control-specific properties")

Now that you have taken full advantage of the properties Flet `Control` and `ConstrainedControl` offer, let's define the properties that are specific to the new Control you are building.

In the FletSpinkit example, let's define its `color` and `size`.

In Python class, define new `color` and `size` properties:

```
from enum import Enumfrom typing import Any, Optionalfrom flet.core.constrained_control import ConstrainedControlfrom flet.core.control import OptionalNumberfrom flet.core.types import ColorEnums, ColorValueclass FletSpinkit(ConstrainedControl):    """    FletSpinkit Control.    """    def __init__(        self,        #        # Control        #        opacity: OptionalNumber = None,        tooltip: Optional[str] = None,        visible: Optional[bool] = None,        data: Any = None,        #        # ConstrainedControl        #        left: OptionalNumber = None,        top: OptionalNumber = None,        right: OptionalNumber = None,        bottom: OptionalNumber = None,        #        # FletSpinkit specific        #        color: Optional[ColorValue] = None,        size: OptionalNumber = None,    ):        ConstrainedControl.__init__(            self,            tooltip=tooltip,            opacity=opacity,            visible=visible,            data=data,            left=left,            top=top,            right=right,            bottom=bottom,        )        self.color = color        self.size = size    def _get_control_name(self):        return "flet_spinkit"    # color    @property    def color(self) -> Optional[ColorValue]:        return self.__color    @color.setter    def color(self, value: Optional[ColorValue]):        self.__color = value        self._set_enum_attr("color", value, ColorEnums)    # size    @property    def size(self):        return self._get_attr("size")    @size.setter    def size(self, value):        self._set_attr("size", value)
```

In `src/flet_spinkit.dart` file, use helper methods `attrColor` and `attrDouble` to access color and size values:

```
import 'package:flet/flet.dart';import 'package:flutter/material.dart';import 'package:flutter_spinkit/flutter_spinkit.dart';class FletSpinkitControl extends StatelessWidget {  final Control? parent;  final Control control;  const FletSpinkitControl({    super.key,    required this.parent,    required this.control,  });  @override  Widget build(BuildContext context) {    var color = control.attrColor("color", context);    var size = control.attrDouble("size");    Widget myControl = SpinKitRotatingCircle(      color: color,      size: size ?? 100,    );    return constrainedControl(context, myControl, parent, control);  }}
```

Use `color` and `size` properties in your app:

```
import flet as ftfrom flet_spinkit import FletSpinkitdef main(page: ft.Page):    page.vertical_alignment = ft.MainAxisAlignment.CENTER    page.horizontal_alignment = ft.CrossAxisAlignment.CENTER    page.add(        ft.Stack(            [                ft.Container(height=200, width=200, bgcolor=ft.Colors.BLUE_100),                FletSpinkit(                    opacity=0.5,                    tooltip="Spinkit tooltip",                    top=0,                    left=0,                    color=ft.Colors.YELLOW,                    size=150,                ),            ]        )    )ft.app(main)
```

```

## Examples[​](/docs/extend/user-extensions#examples "Direct link to Examples")

Flet has controls that are implemented as [built-in extensions](/docs/extend/built-in-extensions) and could serve as a starting point for your own controls.

# Controls reference

Flet UI is built of controls. Controls are organized into hierarchy, or a tree, where each control has a parent (except [Page](/docs/controls/page)) and container controls like [Column](/docs/controls/column), [Dropdown](/docs/controls/dropdown) can contain child controls, for example:

```
Page ├─ TextField ├─ Dropdown │   ├─ Option │   └─ Option └─ Row     ├─ ElevatedButton     └─ ElevatedButton
```

## Common control properties[​](/docs/controls#common-control-properties "Direct link to Common control properties")

Flet controls have the following properties:

### `adaptive`[​](/docs/controls#adaptive "Direct link to adaptive")

`adaptive` property can be specified for a control in the following cases:

-   A control has matching Cupertino control with similar functionality/presentation and graphics as expected on iOS/macOS. In this case, if `adaptive` is `True`, either Material or Cupertino control will be created depending on the target platform.
    
    These controls have their Cupertino analogs and `adaptive` property:
    
    -   [`AlertDialog`](/docs/controls/alertdialog)
    -   [`AppBar`](/docs/controls/appbar)
    -   [`Checkbox`](/docs/controls/checkbox)
    -   [`ListTile`](/docs/controls/listtile)
    -   [`NavigationBar`](/docs/controls/navigationbar)
    -   [`Radio`](/docs/controls/radio)
    -   [`Slider`](/docs/controls/slider)
    -   [`Switch`](/docs/controls/switch)
-   A control has child controls. In this case `adaptive` property value is passed on to its children that don't have their `adaptive` property set.
    
    The following container controls have `adaptive` property:
    
    -   [`Card`](/docs/controls/card)
    -   [`Column`](/docs/controls/column)
    -   [`Container`](/docs/controls/container)
    -   [`Dismissible`](/docs/controls/dismissible)
    -   [`ExpansionPanel`](/docs/controls/expansionpanel)
    -   [`FletApp`](/docs/controls/fletapp)
    -   [`GestureDetector`](/docs/controls/gesturedetector)
    -   [`GridView`](/docs/controls/gridview)
    -   [`ListView`](/docs/controls/listview)
    -   [`Page`](/docs/controls/page)
    -   [`Row`](/docs/controls/row)
    -   [`SafeArea`](/docs/controls/safearea)
    -   [`Stack`](/docs/controls/stack)
    -   [`Tabs`](/docs/controls/tabs)
    -   [`View`](/docs/controls/view)

### `badge`[​](/docs/controls#badge "Direct link to badge")

The `badge` property (available in almost all controls) supports both strings and [`Badge`](/docs/reference/types/badge) objects.

### `bottom`[​](/docs/controls#bottom "Direct link to bottom")

Effective inside [`Stack`](/docs/controls/stack) only. The distance that the child's bottom edge is inset from the bottom of the stack.

### `data`[​](/docs/controls#data "Direct link to data")

Arbitrary data that can be attached to a control.

### `disabled`[​](/docs/controls#disabled "Direct link to disabled")

Every control has `disabled` property which is `False` by default - control and all its children are enabled. `disabled` property is mostly used with data entry controls like `TextField`, `Dropdown`, `Checkbox`, buttons. However, `disabled` could be set to a parent control and its value will be propagated down to all children recursively.

For example, if you have a form with multiple entry controls you can disable them all together by disabling container:

```
c = ft.Column(controls=[    ft.TextField(),    ft.TextField()])c.disabled = Truepage.add(c)
```

### `expand`[​](/docs/controls#expand "Direct link to expand")

When a child Control is placed into a [`Column`](/docs/controls/column) or a [`Row`](/docs/controls/row) you can "expand" it to fill the available space. `expand` property could be a boolean value (`True` - expand control to fill all available space) or an integer - an "expand factor" specifying how to divide a free space with other expanded child controls.

For more information and examples about `expand` property see "Expanding children" sections in [`Column`](/docs/controls/column#expanding-children) or [`Row`](/docs/controls/row#expanding-children).

### `expand_loose`[​](/docs/controls#expand_loose "Direct link to expand_loose")

Effective only if `expand` is `True`.

If `expand_loose` is `True`, the child control of a [`Column`](/docs/controls/column) or a [`Row`](/docs/controls/row) will be given the flexibility to expand to fill the available space in the main axis (e.g., horizontally for a Row or vertically for a Column), but will not be required to fill the available space.

The default value is `False`.

Here is the example of Containers placed in Rows with `expand_loose = True`:

```
import flet as ftclass Message(ft.Container):    def __init__(self, author, body):        super().__init__()        self.content = ft.Column(            controls=[                ft.Text(author, weight=ft.FontWeight.BOLD),                ft.Text(body),            ],        )        self.border = ft.border.all(1, ft.Colors.BLACK)        self.border_radius = ft.border_radius.all(10)        self.bgcolor = ft.Colors.GREEN_200        self.padding = 10        self.expand = True        self.expand_loose = Truedef main(page: ft.Page):    chat = ft.ListView(        padding=10,        spacing=10,        controls=[            ft.Row(                alignment=ft.MainAxisAlignment.START,                controls=[                    Message(                        author="John",                        body="Hi, how are you?",                    ),                ],            ),            ft.Row(                alignment=ft.MainAxisAlignment.END,                controls=[                    Message(                        author="Jake",                        body="Hi I am good thanks, how about you?",                    ),                ],            ),            ft.Row(                alignment=ft.MainAxisAlignment.START,                controls=[                    Message(                        author="John",                        body="Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.",                    ),                ],            ),            ft.Row(                alignment=ft.MainAxisAlignment.END,                controls=[                    Message(                        author="Jake",                        body="Thank you!",                    ),                ],            ),        ],    )    page.window.width = 393    page.window.height = 600    page.window.always_on_top = False    page.add(chat)ft.app(main)
```

### `height`[​](/docs/controls#height "Direct link to height")

Imposed Control height in virtual pixels.

### `left`[​](/docs/controls#left "Direct link to left")

Effective inside [`Stack`](/docs/controls/stack) only. The distance that the child's left edge is inset from the left of the stack.

### `parent`[​](/docs/controls#parent "Direct link to parent")

Points to the direct ancestor(parent) of this control.

It defaults to `None` and will only have a value when this control is mounted (added to the page tree).

The `Page` control (which is the root of the tree) is an exception - it always has `parent=None`.

### `right`[​](/docs/controls#right "Direct link to right")

Effective inside [`Stack`](/docs/controls/stack) only. The distance that the child's right edge is inset from the right of the stack.

### `tooltip`[​](/docs/controls#tooltip "Direct link to tooltip")

The `tooltip` property (available in almost all controls) now supports both strings and [`Tooltip`](/docs/reference/types/tooltip) objects.

### `top`[​](/docs/controls#top "Direct link to top")

Effective inside [`Stack`](/docs/controls/stack) only. The distance that the child's top edge is inset from the top of the stack.

### `visible`[​](/docs/controls#visible "Direct link to visible")

Every control has `visible` property which is `True` by default - control is rendered on the page. Setting `visible` to `False` completely prevents control (and all its children if any) from rendering on a page canvas. Hidden controls cannot be focused or selected with a keyboard or mouse and they do not emit any events.

### `width`[​](/docs/controls#width "Direct link to width")

Imposed Control width in virtual pixels.

## Transformations[​](/docs/controls#transformations "Direct link to Transformations")

### `offset`[​](/docs/controls#offset "Direct link to offset")

Applies a translation transformation before painting the control.

The translation is expressed as a `transform.Offset` scaled to the control's size. For example, an `Offset` with a `x` of `0.25` will result in a horizontal translation of one quarter the width of the control.

The following example displays container at `0, 0` top left corner of a stack as transform applies `-1 * 100, -1 * 100` (`offset * control_size`) horizontal and vertical translations to the control:

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    page.add(        ft.Stack(            [                ft.Container(                    bgcolor="red",                    width=100,                    height=100,                    left=100,                    top=100,                    offset=ft.transform.Offset(-1, -1),                )            ],            width=1000,            height=1000,        )    )ft.app(main)
```

### `opacity`[​](/docs/controls#opacity "Direct link to opacity")

Defines the transparency of the control.

Value ranges from `0.0` (completely transparent) to `1.0` (completely opaque without any transparency) and defaults to `1.0`.

### `rotate`[​](/docs/controls#rotate "Direct link to rotate")

Transforms control using a rotation around the center.

The value of `rotate` property could be one of the following types:

-   `number` - a rotation in clockwise radians. Full circle `360°` is `math.pi * 2` radians, `90°` is `pi / 2`, `45°` is `pi / 4`, etc.
-   `transform.Rotate` - allows to specify rotation `angle` as well as `alignment` - the location of rotation center.

For example:

```
ft.Image(    src="https://picsum.photos/100/100",    width=100,    height=100,    border_radius=5,    rotate=Rotate(angle=0.25 * pi, alignment=ft.alignment.center_left))
```

### `scale`[​](/docs/controls#scale "Direct link to scale")

Scale control along the 2D plane. Default scale factor is `1.0` - control is not scaled. `0.5` - the control is twice smaller, `2.0` - the control is twice larger.

Different scale multipliers can be specified for `x` and `y` axis, but setting `Control.scale` property to an instance of `transform.Scale` class:

```
from dataclasses import fieldclass Scale:    scale: float = field(default=None)    scale_x: float = field(default=None)    scale_y: float = field(default=None)    alignment: Alignment = field(default=None)
```

Either `scale` or `scale_x` and `scale_y` could be specified, but not all of them, for example:

```
ft.Image(    src="https://picsum.photos/100/100",    width=100,    height=100,    border_radius=5,    scale=Scale(scale_x=2, scale_y=0.5))
```

## Properties[​](/docs/controls/card#properties "Direct link to Properties")

### `clip_behavior`[​](/docs/controls/card#clip_behavior "Direct link to clip_behavior")

The `content` will be clipped (or not) according to this option.

Value is of type [`ClipBehavior`](/docs/reference/types/clipbehavior) and defaults to `ClipBehavior.NONE`.

### `color`[​](/docs/controls/card#color "Direct link to color")

The card's background [color](/docs/reference/colors).

### `content`[​](/docs/controls/card#content "Direct link to content")

The `Control` that should be displayed inside the card.

This control can only have one child. To lay out multiple children, let this control's child be a control such as [`Row`](/docs/controls/row), [`Column`](/docs/controls/column), or [`Stack`](/docs/controls/stack), which have a children property, and then provide the children to that control.

### `elevation`[​](/docs/controls/card#elevation "Direct link to elevation")

Controls the size of the shadow below the card. Default value is `1.0`.

### `is_semantic_container`[​](/docs/controls/card#is_semantic_container "Direct link to is_semantic_container")

Set to `True` (default) if this card represents a single semantic container, or to `False` if it instead represents a collection of individual semantic nodes (different types of content).

### `margin`[​](/docs/controls/card#margin "Direct link to margin")

The empty space that surrounds the card.

Value can be one of the following types: `int`, `float`, or [`Margin`](/docs/reference/types/margin).

### `shadow_color`[​](/docs/controls/card#shadow_color "Direct link to shadow_color")

The [color](/docs/reference/colors) to paint the shadow below the card.

### `shape`[​](/docs/controls/card#shape "Direct link to shape")

The shape of the card.

Value is of type [`OutlinedBorder`](/docs/reference/types/outlinedborder) and defaults to `RoundedRectangleBorder(radius=4.0)`.

### `show_border_on_foreground`[​](/docs/controls/card#show_border_on_foreground "Direct link to show_border_on_foreground")

Whether the shape of the border should be painted in front of the `content` or behind.

Defaults to `True`.

### `surface_tint_color`[​](/docs/controls/card#surface_tint_color "Direct link to surface_tint_color")

The [color](/docs/reference/colors) used as an overlay on `color` to indicate elevation.

If this is `None`, no overlay will be applied. Otherwise this color will be composited on top of `color` with an opacity related to `elevation` and used to paint the background of the card.

Defaults to `None`.

### `variant`[​](/docs/controls/card#variant "Direct link to variant")

Defines the card variant to be used.

Value is of type [`CardVariant`](/docs/reference/types/cardvariant) and defaults to `CardVariant.ELEVATED`.

Throttling in milliseconds for `on_scroll` event.

Defaults to `10`.

### `rtl`[​](/docs/controls/column#rtl "Direct link to rtl")

`True` to set text direction to right-to-left.

Defaults to `False`.

### `run_alignment`[​](/docs/controls/column#run_alignment "Direct link to run_alignment")

How the runs should be placed in the cross-axis when `wrap=True`.

Value is of type [`MainAxisAlignment`](/docs/reference/types/mainaxisalignment) and defaults to `MainAxisAlignment.START`.

### `run_spacing`[​](/docs/controls/column#run_spacing "Direct link to run_spacing")

Spacing between runs when `wrap=True`. Default value is 10.

### `scroll`[​](/docs/controls/column#scroll "Direct link to scroll")

Enables a vertical scrolling for the Column to prevent its content overflow.

Value is of type [`ScrollMode`](/docs/reference/types/scrollmode) and defaults to `ScrollMode.None`.

### `spacing`[​](/docs/controls/column#spacing "Direct link to spacing")

Spacing between the `controls`. It is applied only when `alignment` is set to `MainAxisAlignment.START`, `MainAxisAlignment.END` or `MainAxisAlignment.CENTER`.

Default value is `10` virtual pixels.

### `tight`[​](/docs/controls/column#tight "Direct link to tight")

Specifies how much space should be occupied vertically.

Defaults to `False` - allocate all space to children.

### `wrap`[​](/docs/controls/column#wrap "Direct link to wrap")

When set to `True` the Column will put child controls into additional columns (runs) if they don't fit a single column.

## Methods[​](/docs/controls/column#methods "Direct link to Methods")

### `scroll_to(offset, delta, key, duration, curve)`[​](/docs/controls/column#scroll_tooffset-delta-key-duration-curve "Direct link to scroll_tooffset-delta-key-duration-curve")

Moves scroll position to either absolute `offset`, relative `delta` or jump to the control with specified `key`.

`offset` is an absolute value between minimum and maximum extents of a scrollable control, for example:

```
products.scroll_to(offset=100, duration=1000)
```

`offset` could be a negative to scroll from the end of a scrollable. For example, to scroll to the very end:

```
products.scroll_to(offset=-1, duration=1000)
```

`delta` allows moving scroll relatively to the current position. Use positive `delta` to scroll forward and negative `delta` to scroll backward. For example, to move scroll on 50 pixels forward:

```
products.scroll_to(delta=50)
```

`key` allows moving scroll position to a control with specified `key`. Most of Flet controls have `key` property which is translated to Flutter as "global key". `key` must be unique for the entire page/view. For example:

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    cl = ft.Column(        spacing=10,        height=200,        width=200,        scroll=ft.ScrollMode.ALWAYS,    )    for i in range(0, 50):        cl.controls.append(ft.Text(f"Text line {i}", key=str(i)))    def scroll_to_key(e):        cl.scroll_to(key="20", duration=1000)    page.add(        ft.Container(cl, border=ft.border.all(1)),        ft.ElevatedButton("Scroll to key '20'", on_click=scroll_to_key),    )ft.app(main)
```

note

`scroll_to()` method won't work with `ListView` and `GridView` controls building their items dynamically.

`duration` is scrolling animation duration in milliseconds. Defaults to `0` - no animation.

`curve` configures animation curve. Property value is [`AnimationCurve`](/docs/reference/types/animationcurve) enum. Defaults to `AnimationCurve.EASE`.

## Events[​](/docs/controls/column#events "Direct link to Events")

### `on_scroll`[​](/docs/controls/column#on_scroll "Direct link to on_scroll")

Fires when scroll position is changed by a user.

Event handler argument is an instance of [`OnScrollEvent`](/docs/reference/types/onscrollevent) class.

## Expanding children[​](/docs/controls/column#expanding-children "Direct link to Expanding children")

When a child Control is placed into a Column you can "expand" it to fill the available space. Every Control has `expand` property that can have either a boolean value (`True` - expand control to fill all available space) or an integer - an "expand factor" specifying how to divide a free space with other expanded child controls. For example, this code creates a column with a Container taking all available space and a Text control at the bottom serving as a status bar:

```
r = ft.Column([  ft.Container(expand=True, content=ft.Text("Here is search results")),  ft.Text("Records found: 10")])
```

The following example with numeric expand factors creates a Column with 3 containers in it and having heights of `20% (1/5)`, `60% (3/5)` and `20% (1/5)` respectively:

```
r = ft.Column([  ft.Container(expand=1, content=ft.Text("Header")),  ft.Container(expand=3, content=ft.Text("Body")),  ft.Container(expand=1, content=ft.Text("Footer"))])
```

In general, the resulting height of a child in percents is calculated as `expand / sum(all expands) * 100%`.

If you need to give the child Control of the Column the flexibility to expand to fill the available space vertically but not require it to fill the available space, set its `expand_loose` property to `True`.

A simple usage example:

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    page.vertical_alignment = ft.MainAxisAlignment.CENTER    page.horizontal_alignment = ft.CrossAxisAlignment.CENTER    def on_long_press(e):        print("on long press")        page.add(ft.Text("on_long_press triggered"))    def on_click(e):        print("on click")        page.add(ft.Text("on_click triggered"))    def on_tap_down(e: ft.ContainerTapEvent):        print("on tap down", e.local_x, e.local_y)        page.add(ft.Text("on_tap_down triggered"))    c = ft.Container(        bgcolor=ft.Colors.RED,        content=ft.Text("Test Long Press"),        height=100,        width=100,        on_click=on_click,        on_long_press=on_long_press,        on_tap_down=on_tap_down,    )        page.add(c)ft.app(main)

# CupertinoListTile

An iOS-style list tile. The CupertinoListTile is a Cupertino equivalent of Material [ListTile](/docs/controls/listtile).

It comes in two forms, an old-fashioned edge-to-edge variant known from iOS Settings app and in a new, "Inset Grouped" form, known from either iOS Notes or Reminders app. The first form is created if `notched` property is `False` (default value) and the second form is created is [`notched`](/docs/controls/cupertinolisttile#notched) is `True`.

## Examples[​](/docs/controls/cupertinolisttile#examples "Direct link to Examples")

The current primary sort key's column.

If specified, indicates that the indicated column is the column by which the data is sorted. The number must correspond to the index of the relevant column in `columns`.

Setting this will cause the relevant column to have a sort indicator displayed.

When this is `None`, it implies that the table's sort order does not correspond to any of the columns.

### `vertical_lines`[​](/docs/controls/datatable#vertical_lines "Direct link to vertical_lines")

Set the [color](/docs/reference/colors) and width of vertical lines between columns.

Value is of type [`BorderSide`](/docs/reference/types/borderside).

## `DataTable` events[​](/docs/controls/datatable#datatable-events "Direct link to datatable-events")

### `on_select_all`[​](/docs/controls/datatable#on_select_all "Direct link to on_select_all")

Invoked when the user selects or unselects every row, using the checkbox in the heading row.

If this is `None`, then the `DataRow.on_select_changed` callback of every row in the table is invoked appropriately instead.

To control whether a particular row is selectable or not, see `DataRow.on_select_changed`. This callback is only relevant if any row is selectable.

## `DataColumn`[​](/docs/controls/datatable#datacolumn "Direct link to datacolumn")

Column configuration for a `DataTable`.

One column configuration must be provided for each column to display in the table.

### `label`[​](/docs/controls/datatable#label "Direct link to label")

The column heading.

Typically, this will be a `Text` control. It could also be an `Icon` (typically using size 18), or a `Row` with an icon and some text.

### `numeric`[​](/docs/controls/datatable#numeric "Direct link to numeric")

Whether this column represents numeric data or not.

The contents of cells of columns containing numeric data are right-aligned.

### `tooltip`[​](/docs/controls/datatable#tooltip "Direct link to tooltip")

The column heading's tooltip.

This is a longer description of the column heading, for cases where the heading might have been abbreviated to keep the column width to a reasonable size.

## `DataColumn` events[​](/docs/controls/datatable#datacolumn-events "Direct link to datacolumn-events")

### `on_sort`[​](/docs/controls/datatable#on_sort "Direct link to on_sort")

Called when the user asks to sort the table using this column.

If not set, the column will not be considered sortable.

## `DataRow`[​](/docs/controls/datatable#datarow "Direct link to datarow")

Row configuration and cell data for a DataTable.

One row configuration must be provided for each row to display in the table.

The data for this row of the table is provided in the `cells` property of the `DataRow` object.

### `cells`[​](/docs/controls/datatable#cells "Direct link to cells")

The data for this row - a list of [`DataCell`](/docs/controls/datatable#datacell) controls.

There must be exactly as many cells as there are columns in the table.

### `color`[​](/docs/controls/datatable#color "Direct link to color")

The [color](/docs/reference/colors) for the row.

By default, the color is transparent unless selected. Selected rows has a grey translucent color.

The effective color can depend on the [`ControlState`](/docs/reference/types/controlstate) state, if the row is selected, pressed, hovered, focused, disabled or enabled. The color is painted as an overlay to the row. To make sure that the row's InkWell is visible (when pressed, hovered and focused), it is recommended to use a translucent color.

### `selected`[​](/docs/controls/datatable#selected "Direct link to selected")

Whether the row is selected.

If `on_select_changed` is non-null for any row in the table, then a checkbox is shown at the start of each row. If the row is selected (`True`), the checkbox will be checked and the row will be highlighted.

Otherwise, the checkbox, if present, will not be checked.

## `DataRow` events[​](/docs/controls/datatable#datarow-events "Direct link to datarow-events")

### `on_long_press`[​](/docs/controls/datatable#on_long_press "Direct link to on_long_press")

Called if the row is long-pressed.

If a `DataCell` in the row has its `DataCell.on_tap`, `DataCell.on_double_tap`, `DataCell.on_long_press`, `DataCell.on_tap_cancel` or `DataCell.on_tap_down` callback defined, that callback behavior overrides the gesture behavior of the row for that particular cell.

### `on_select_changed`[​](/docs/controls/datatable#on_select_changed "Direct link to on_select_changed")

Called when the user selects or unselects a selectable row.

If this is not null, then the row is selectable. The current selection state of the row is given by selected.

If any row is selectable, then the table's heading row will have a checkbox that can be checked to select all selectable rows (and which is checked if all the rows are selected), and each subsequent row will have a checkbox to toggle just that row.

A row whose `on_select_changed` callback is null is ignored for the purposes of determining the state of the "all" checkbox, and its checkbox is disabled.

If a `DataCell` in the row has its `DataCell.on_tap` callback defined, that callback behavior overrides the gesture behavior of the row for that particular cell.

## `DataCell`[​](/docs/controls/datatable#datacell "Direct link to datacell")

The data for a cell of a `DataTable`.

One list of DataCell objects must be provided for each `DataRow` in the `DataTable`.

### `content`[​](/docs/controls/datatable#content "Direct link to content")

The data for the row.

Typically a `Text` control or a `Dropdown` control.

If the cell has no data, then a `Text` widget with placeholder text should be provided instead, and `placeholder` should be set to `True`.

This control can only have one child. To lay out multiple children, let this control's child be a widget such as `Row`, `Column`, or `Stack`, which have `controls` property, and then provide the children to that widget.

### `placeholder`[​](/docs/controls/datatable#placeholder "Direct link to placeholder")

Whether the child is actually a placeholder.

If this is `True`, the default text style for the cell is changed to be appropriate for placeholder text.

### `show_edit_icon`[​](/docs/controls/datatable#show_edit_icon "Direct link to show_edit_icon")

Whether to show an edit icon at the end of the cell.

This does not make the cell actually editable; the caller must implement editing behavior if desired (initiated from the `on_tap` callback).

If this is set, `on_tap` should also be set, otherwise tapping the icon will have no effect.

## `DataCell` events[​](/docs/controls/datatable#datacell-events "Direct link to datacell-events")

### `on_double_tap`[​](/docs/controls/datatable#on_double_tap "Direct link to on_double_tap")

Called when the cell is double tapped.

If specified, tapping the cell will call this callback, else (tapping the cell will attempt to select the row ( if `DataRow.on_select_changed` is provided).

### `on_long_press`[​](/docs/controls/datatable#on_long_press-1 "Direct link to on_long_press-1")

Called if the cell is long-pressed.

If specified, tapping the cell will invoke this callback, else tapping the cell will attempt to select the row ( if `DataRow.on_select_changed` is provided).

### `on_tap`[​](/docs/controls/datatable#on_tap "Direct link to on_tap")

Called if the cell is tapped.

If specified, tapping the cell will call this callback, else tapping the cell will attempt to select the row ( if `DataRow.on_select_changed` is provided).

### `on_tap_cancel`[​](/docs/controls/datatable#on_tap_cancel "Direct link to on_tap_cancel")

Called if the user cancels a tap was started on cell.

If specified, cancelling the tap gesture will invoke this callback, else tapping the cell will attempt to select the row (if `DataRow.on_select_changed` is provided).

### `on_tap_down`[​](/docs/controls/datatable#on_tap_down "Direct link to on_tap_down")

Called if the cell is tapped down.

If specified, tapping the cell will call this callback, else tapping the cell will attempt to select the row ( if `DataRow.on_select_changed` is provided).

## Properties[​](/docs/controls/dismissible#properties "Direct link to Properties")

### `background`[​](/docs/controls/dismissible#background "Direct link to background")

A Control that is stacked behind the `content`.

If `secondary_background` is also specified, then this control only appears when the content has been dragged down or to the right.

### `content`[​](/docs/controls/dismissible#content "Direct link to content")

A child Control contained by the Dismissible.

### `cross_axis_end_offset`[​](/docs/controls/dismissible#cross_axis_end_offset "Direct link to cross_axis_end_offset")

Specifies the end offset along the main axis once the card has been dismissed.

If non-zero value is given then widget moves in cross direction depending on whether it is positive or negative.

### `dismiss_direction`[​](/docs/controls/dismissible#dismiss_direction "Direct link to dismiss_direction")

The direction in which the control can be dismissed.

Value is of type [`DismissDirection`](/docs/reference/types/dismissdirection).

### `dismiss_thresholds`[​](/docs/controls/dismissible#dismiss_thresholds "Direct link to dismiss_thresholds")

The offset threshold the item has to be dragged in order to be considered dismissed.

Ex: a threshold of `0.4` (the default) means that the item has to be dragged *at least* 40% in order for it to be dismissed.

It is specified as a dictionary where the key is of type [`DismissDirection`](/docs/reference/types/dismissdirection) and the value is the threshold(fractional/decimal value between `0.0` and `1.0`):

```
ft.Dismissible(    # ...    dismiss_thresholds={        ft.DismissDirection.VERTICAL: 0.1,        ft.DismissDirection.START_TO_END: 0.7    })
```

### `movement_duration`[​](/docs/controls/dismissible#movement_duration "Direct link to movement_duration")

The duration for card to dismiss or to come back to original position if not dismissed.

### `resize_duration`[​](/docs/controls/dismissible#resize_duration "Direct link to resize_duration")

The amount of time the control will spend contracting before `on_dismiss` is called.

### `secondary_background`[​](/docs/controls/dismissible#secondary_background "Direct link to secondary_background")

A control that is stacked behind the `content` and is exposed when the `content` has been dragged up or to the left.

Has no effect if `background` is not specified.

## Events[​](/docs/controls/dismissible#events "Direct link to Events")

### `on_confirm_dismiss`[​](/docs/controls/dismissible#on_confirm_dismiss "Direct link to on_confirm_dismiss")

Gives the app an opportunity to confirm or veto a pending dismissal. The widget cannot be dragged again until the returned this pending dismissal is resolved.

To resolve the pending dismissal, call the `confirm_dismiss(dismiss)` method passing it a boolean representing the decision. If `True`, then the control will be dismissed, otherwise it will be moved back to its original location.

See the example at the top of this page for a possible implementation.

### `on_dismiss`[​](/docs/controls/dismissible#on_dismiss "Direct link to on_dismiss")

Fires when this control has been dismissed, after finishing resizing.

### `on_resize`[​](/docs/controls/dismissible#on_resize "Direct link to on_resize")

Fires when this control changes size, for example, when contracting before being dismissed.

### `on_update`[​](/docs/controls/dismissible#on_update "Direct link to on_update")

Fires when this control has been dragged.

## Methods[​](/docs/controls/dismissible#methods "Direct link to Methods")

### `confirm_dismiss(dismiss: bool)`[​](/docs/controls/dismissible#confirm_dismissdismiss-bool "Direct link to confirm_dismissdismiss-bool")

Resolves the pending dismissal. To be called while handling the `on_confirm_dismiss` event.

# GridView

A scrollable, 2D array of controls.

info

GridView is very effective for large lists (thousands of items). Prefer it over wrapping [`Column`](/docs/controls/column) or [`Row`](/docs/controls/row) for smooth scrolling. See [Flet Icons Browser](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/main/python/apps/icons-browser/main.py) for GridView usage example.

Defines whether the scroll view scrolls in the reading direction.

Defaults to `False`.

### `run_spacing`[​](/docs/controls/gridview#run_spacing "Direct link to run_spacing")

The number of logical pixels between each child along the cross axis.

### `runs_count`[​](/docs/controls/gridview#runs_count "Direct link to runs_count")

The number of children in the cross axis.

### `semantic_child_count`[​](/docs/controls/gridview#semantic_child_count "Direct link to semantic_child_count")

The number of children that will contribute semantic information.

### `spacing`[​](/docs/controls/gridview#spacing "Direct link to spacing")

The number of logical pixels between each child along the main axis.

### `scroll_to(offset, delta, key, duration, curve)`[​](/docs/controls/gridview#scroll_tooffset-delta-key-duration-curve "Direct link to scroll_tooffset-delta-key-duration-curve")

Moves scroll position to either absolute `offset`, relative `delta` or jump to the control with specified `key`.

See [`Column.scroll_to()`](/docs/controls/column#scroll_tooffset-delta-key-duration-curve) for method details and examples.

## Events[​](/docs/controls/gridview#events "Direct link to Events")

### `on_scroll`[​](/docs/controls/gridview#on_scroll "Direct link to on_scroll")

Fires when scroll position is changed by a user.

Event handler argument is an instance of [`OnScrollEvent`](/docs/reference/types/onscrollevent) class.

```

## Properties[​](/docs/controls/listtile#properties "Direct link to Properties")

### `adaptive`[​](/docs/controls/listtile#adaptive "Direct link to adaptive")

If the value is `True`, an adaptive ListTile is created based on whether the target platform is iOS/macOS.

On iOS and macOS, a [`CupertinoListTile`](/docs/controls/cupertinolisttile) is created, which has matching functionality and presentation as `ListTile`, and the graphics as expected on iOS. On other platforms, a Material ListTile is created.

If a `CupertinoListTile` is created, the following parameters are ignored: `autofocus`, `dense`, `is_three_line`, `selected` and `on_long_press` event.

Defaults to `False`.

### `autofocus`[​](/docs/controls/listtile#autofocus "Direct link to autofocus")

`True` if the control will be selected as the initial focus. If there is more than one control on a page with autofocus set, then the first one added to the page will get focus.

### `bgcolor`[​](/docs/controls/listtile#bgcolor "Direct link to bgcolor")

The list tile's background [color](/docs/reference/colors).

### `bgcolor_activated`[​](/docs/controls/listtile#bgcolor_activated "Direct link to bgcolor_activated")

The list tile's splash [color](/docs/reference/colors) after the tile was tapped.

### `content_padding`[​](/docs/controls/listtile#content_padding "Direct link to content_padding")

The tile's internal padding. Insets a ListTile's contents: its `leading`, `title`, `subtitle`, and `trailing` controls.

Value is of type [`Padding`](/docs/reference/types/padding) and defaults to `padding.symmetric(horizontal=16)`.

### `dense`[​](/docs/controls/listtile#dense "Direct link to dense")

Whether this list tile is part of a vertically dense list. Dense list tiles default to a smaller height.

### `enable_feedback`[​](/docs/controls/listtile#enable_feedback "Direct link to enable_feedback")

Whether detected gestures should provide acoustic and/or haptic feedback. On Android, for example, setting this to `True` produce a click sound and a long-press will produce a short vibration.

Defaults to `True`.

### `horizontal_spacing`[​](/docs/controls/listtile#horizontal_spacing "Direct link to horizontal_spacing")

The horizontal gap between the `title` and the `leading`/`trailing` controls.

Defaults to `16`.

### `hover_color`[​](/docs/controls/listtile#hover_color "Direct link to hover_color")

The tile's [color](/docs/reference/colors) when hovered.

### `icon_color`[​](/docs/controls/listtile#icon_color "Direct link to icon_color")

Defines the default [color](/docs/reference/colors) for the `Icon`s present in `leading` and `trailing`.

### `is_three_line`[​](/docs/controls/listtile#is_three_line "Direct link to is_three_line")

Whether this list tile is intended to display three lines of text.

If `True`, then subtitle must be non-null (since it is expected to give the second and third lines of text).

If `False`, the list tile is treated as having one line if the subtitle is null and treated as having two lines if the subtitle is non-null.

When using a Text control for title and subtitle, you can enforce line limits using [`Text.max_lines`](/docs/controls/text#max_lines).

### `leading`[​](/docs/controls/listtile#leading "Direct link to leading")

A `Control` to display before the title.

### `leading_and_trailing_text_style`[​](/docs/controls/listtile#leading_and_trailing_text_style "Direct link to leading_and_trailing_text_style")

The [`TextStyle`](/docs/reference/types/textstyle) for the `leading` and `trailing` controls.

### `min_height`[​](/docs/controls/listtile#min_height "Direct link to min_height")

The minimum height allocated for this control.

If `None` or not set, default tile heights are `56.0`, `72.0`, and `88.0` for one, two, and three lines of text respectively. If [`dense`](/docs/controls/listtile#dense) is `True`, these defaults are changed to `48.0`, `64.0`, and `76.0`.

Note that, a visual density value or a large title will also adjust the default tile heights.

The cursor to be displayed when a mouse pointer enters or is hovering over this control. The value is [`MouseCursor`](/docs/reference/types/mousecursor) enum.

### `selected`[​](/docs/controls/listtile#selected "Direct link to selected")

If this tile is also enabled then icons and text are rendered with the same color. By default the selected color is the theme's primary color.

### `selected_color`[​](/docs/controls/listtile#selected_color "Direct link to selected_color")

Defines the [color](/docs/reference/colors) used for icons and text when `selected=True`.

# ResponsiveRow

`ResponsiveRow` borrows the idea of grid layout from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/layout/grid/) web framework.

`ResponsiveRow` allows aligning child controls to virtual columns. By default, a virtual grid has 12 columns, but that can be customized with `ResponsiveRow.columns` property.

Similar to `expand` property, every control now has `col` property which allows specifying how many columns a control should span. For example, to make a layout consisting of two columns spanning 6 virtual columns each:

```
import flet as ftft.ResponsiveRow([    ft.Column(col=6, controls=[ft.Text("Column 1")]),    ft.Column(col=6, controls=[ft.Text("Column 2")])])
```

`ResponsiveRow` is "responsive" because it can adapt the size of its children to a changing screen (page, window) size. `col` property in the example above is a constant number which means the child will span 6 columns for any screen size.

If `ResponsiveRow`'s child doesn't have `col` property specified it spans the maximum number of columns.

`col` can be configured to have a different value for specific "breakpoints". Breakpoints are named dimension ranges:

Breakpoint

Dimension

xs

<576px

sm

≥576px

md

≥768px

lg

≥992px

xl

≥1200px

xxl

≥1400px

For example, the following example collapses content into a single column on a mobile device and takes two columns on larger screens:

```
import flet as ftft.ResponsiveRow([    ft.Column(col={"sm": 6}, controls=[ft.Text("Column 1")]),    ft.Column(col={"sm": 6}, controls=[ft.Text("Column 2")])])
```

## Properties[​](/docs/controls/row#properties "Direct link to Properties")

### `alignment`[​](/docs/controls/row#alignment "Direct link to alignment")

How the child Controls should be placed horizontally.

Value is of type [`MainAxisAlignment`](/docs/reference/types/mainaxisalignment) and defaults to `MainAxisAlignment.START`.

### `auto_scroll`[​](/docs/controls/row#auto_scroll "Direct link to auto_scroll")

`True` if scrollbar should automatically move its position to the end when children updated. Must be `False` for `scroll_to()` method to work.

### `controls`[​](/docs/controls/row#controls "Direct link to controls")

A list of Controls to display inside the Row.

### `rtl`[​](/docs/controls/row#rtl "Direct link to rtl")

`True` to set text direction to right-to-left.

Defaults to `False`.

### `run_alignment`[​](/docs/controls/row#run_alignment "Direct link to run_alignment")

How the runs should be placed in the cross-axis when `wrap=True`.

Value is of type [`MainAxisAlignment`](/docs/reference/types/mainaxisalignment) and defaults to `MainAxisAlignment.START`.

### `run_spacing`[​](/docs/controls/row#run_spacing "Direct link to run_spacing")

Spacing between runs when `wrap=True`.

Defaults to `10`.

### `scroll`[​](/docs/controls/row#scroll "Direct link to scroll")

Enables horizontal scrolling for the Row to prevent its content overflow.

Value is of type [`ScrollMode`](/docs/reference/types/scrollmode).

### `spacing`[​](/docs/controls/row#spacing "Direct link to spacing")

Spacing between controls in a row. Default value is 10 virtual pixels. Spacing is applied only when `alignment` is set to `MainAxisAlignment.START`, `MainAxisAlignment.END` or `MainAxisAlignment.CENTER`.

### `on_scroll_interval`[​](/docs/controls/row#on_scroll_interval "Direct link to on_scroll_interval")

Throttling in milliseconds for `on_scroll` event.

Defaults to `10`.

### `tight`[​](/docs/controls/row#tight "Direct link to tight")

Specifies how much space should be occupied horizontally.

Defaults to `False`, meaning all space is allocated to children.

### `vertical_alignment`[​](/docs/controls/row#vertical_alignment "Direct link to vertical_alignment")

How the child Controls should be placed vertically.

Value is of type [`CrossAxisAlignment`](/docs/reference/types/crossaxisalignment) and defaults to `CrossAxisAlignment.START`.

### `wrap`[​](/docs/controls/row#wrap "Direct link to wrap")

When set to `True` the Row will put child controls into additional rows (runs) if they don't fit a single row.

## Methods[​](/docs/controls/row#methods "Direct link to Methods")

### `scroll_to(offset, delta, key, duration, curve)`[​](/docs/controls/row#scroll_tooffset-delta-key-duration-curve "Direct link to scroll_tooffset-delta-key-duration-curve")

Moves scroll position to either absolute `offset`, relative `delta` or jump to the control with specified `key`.

See [`Column.scroll_to()`](/docs/controls/column#scroll_tooffset-delta-key-duration-curve) for method details and examples.

## Events[​](/docs/controls/row#events "Direct link to Events")

### `on_scroll`[​](/docs/controls/row#on_scroll "Direct link to on_scroll")

Fires when scroll position is changed by a user.

Event handler argument is an instance of [`OnScrollEvent`](/docs/reference/types/onscrollevent) class.

## Expanding children[​](/docs/controls/row#expanding-children "Direct link to Expanding children")

When a child Control is placed into a Row you can "expand" it to fill the available space. Every Control has `expand` property that can have either a boolean value (`True` - expand control to fill all available space) or an integer - an "expand factor" specifying how to divide a free space with other expanded child controls. For example, this code creates a row with a TextField taking all available space and an ElevatedButton next to it:

```
r = ft.Row([  ft.TextField(hint_text="Enter your name", expand=True),  ft.ElevatedButton(text="Join chat")])
```

The following example with numeric expand factors creates a Row with 3 containers in it and having widths of `20% (1/5)`, `60% (3/5)` and `20% (1/5)` respectively:

```
r = ft.Row([  ft.Container(expand=1, content=ft.Text("A")),  ft.Container(expand=3, content=ft.Text("B")),  ft.Container(expand=1, content=ft.Text("C"))])
```

In general, the resulting width of a child in percents is calculated as `expand / sum(all expands) * 100%`.

If you need to give the child Control of the Row the flexibility to expand to fill the available space horizontally but not require it to fill the available space, set its `expand_loose` property to `True`.

# SafeArea

A control that insets its `content` by sufficient padding to avoid intrusions by the operating system.

For example, this will indent the `content` by enough to avoid the status bar at the top of the screen.

It will also indent the `content` by the amount necessary to avoid The Notch on the iPhone X, or other similar creative physical features of the display.

When a `minimum_padding` is specified, the greater of the minimum padding or the safe area padding will be applied.

## Example[​](/docs/controls/safearea#example "Direct link to Example")

Whether to avoid system intrusions on the left.

Defaults to `True`.

### `maintain_bottom_view_padding`[​](/docs/controls/safearea#maintain_bottom_view_padding "Direct link to maintain_bottom_view_padding")

Specifies whether the `SafeArea` should maintain the bottom `MediaQueryData.viewPadding` instead of the bottom `MediaQueryData.padding`, defaults to `False`.

For example, if there is an onscreen keyboard displayed above the SafeArea, the padding can be maintained below the obstruction rather than being consumed. This can be helpful in cases where your layout contains flexible controls, which could visibly move when opening a software keyboard due to the change in the padding value. Setting this to true will avoid the UI shift.

### `minimum_padding`[​](/docs/controls/safearea#minimum_padding "Direct link to minimum_padding")

This minimum padding to apply.

The greater of the minimum insets and the media padding will be applied.

### `right`[​](/docs/controls/safearea#right "Direct link to right")

Whether to avoid system intrusions on the right.

Defaults to `True`.

### `top`[​](/docs/controls/safearea#top "Direct link to top")

Whether to avoid system intrusions at the top of the screen, typically the system status bar.

Defaults to `True`.

# Stack

A control that positions its children on top of each other.

This control is useful if you want to overlap several children in a simple way, for example having some text and an image, overlaid with a gradient and a button attached to the bottom.

Stack is also useful if you want to implement [implicit animations](/docs/cookbook/animations) that require knowing absolute position of a target value.

# Tabs

The Tabs control is used for navigating frequently accessed, distinct content categories. Tabs allow for navigation between two or more content views and relies on text headers to articulate the different sections of content.

## Examples[​](/docs/controls/appbar#examples "Direct link to Examples")

[Live example](https://flet-controls-gallery.fly.dev/navigation/appbar)

### AppBar[​](/docs/controls/appbar#appbar "Direct link to AppBar")

-   Python

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    def check_item_clicked(e):        e.control.checked = not e.control.checked        page.update()    page.appbar = ft.AppBar(        leading=ft.Icon(ft.Icons.PALETTE),        leading_width=40,        title=ft.Text("AppBar Example"),        center_title=False,        bgcolor=ft.Colors.SURFACE_VARIANT,        actions=[            ft.IconButton(ft.Icons.WB_SUNNY_OUTLINED),            ft.IconButton(ft.Icons.FILTER_3),            ft.PopupMenuButton(                items=[                    ft.PopupMenuItem(text="Item 1"),                    ft.PopupMenuItem(),  # divider                    ft.PopupMenuItem(                        text="Checked item", checked=False, on_click=check_item_clicked                    ),                ]            ),        ],    )    page.add(ft.Text("Body!"))ft.app(main)
```

## Properties[​](/docs/controls/appbar#properties "Direct link to Properties")

### `actions`[​](/docs/controls/appbar#actions "Direct link to actions")

A list of `Control`s to display in a row after the title control.

Typically these controls are [`IconButtons`](/docs/controls/iconbutton) representing common operations. For less common operations, consider using a [`PopupMenuButton`](/docs/controls/popupmenubutton) as the last action.

**Note** that, if `AppBar.adaptive=True` and the app is opened on an iOS or macOS device, only the first element of this list will be used. This is because the `CupertinoAppBar`(which will be used on those two platforms) only accepts one - trailing - action control.

### `adaptive`[​](/docs/controls/appbar#adaptive "Direct link to adaptive")

If the value is `True`, an adaptive AppBar is created based on whether the target platform is iOS/macOS.

On iOS and macOS, a [`CupertinoAppBar`](/docs/controls/cupertinoappbar) is created, which has matching functionality and presentation as `AppBar`, and the graphics as expected on iOS. On other platforms, a Material AppBar is created.

Value is of type `bool` and defaults to `False`.

### `automatically_imply_leading`[​](/docs/controls/appbar#automatically_imply_leading "Direct link to automatically_imply_leading")

Controls whether we should try to imply the leading widget if null.

If `True` and `leading` is null, automatically try to deduce what the leading widget should be. If `False` and `leading` is null, leading space is given to title. If leading widget is not null, this parameter has no effect.

Value is of type `bool`.

### `bgcolor`[​](/docs/controls/appbar#bgcolor "Direct link to bgcolor")

The fill [color](/docs/reference/colors) to use for an AppBar. Default color is defined by current theme.

### `center_title`[​](/docs/controls/appbar#center_title "Direct link to center_title")

Whether the title should be centered.

Value is of type `bool` and defaults to `False`.

### `clip_behavior`[​](/docs/controls/appbar#clip_behavior "Direct link to clip_behavior")

The content will be clipped (or not) according to this option.

Value is of type [`ClipBehavior`](/docs/reference/types/clipbehavior).

### `color`[​](/docs/controls/appbar#color "Direct link to color")

The default [color](/docs/reference/colors) for `Text` and `Icon` controls within the app bar. Default color is defined by current theme.

### `elevation`[​](/docs/controls/appbar#elevation "Direct link to elevation")

The app bar's elevation.

Note: This effect is only visible when using the Material 2 design (`Theme.use_material3=False`).

Value is of type [`OptionalNumber`](/docs/reference/types/aliases#optionalnumber) and defaults to `4`.

### `elevation_on_scroll`[​](/docs/controls/appbar#elevation_on_scroll "Direct link to elevation_on_scroll")

The elevation to be used if this app bar has something scrolled underneath it.

Value is of type [`OptionalNumber`](/docs/reference/types/aliases#optionalnumber).

### `exclude_header_semantics`[​](/docs/controls/appbar#exclude_header_semantics "Direct link to exclude_header_semantics")

Whether the `title` should be wrapped with header [`Semantics`](/docs/controls/semantics).

Value is of type `bool` and defaults to `False`.

### `force_material_transparency`[​](/docs/controls/appbar#force_material_transparency "Direct link to force_material_transparency")

Forces the app bar to be transparent (instead of Material's default type).

This will also remove the visual display of `bgcolor` and `elevation`, and affect other characteristics of this app bar.

Value is of type `bool`.

### `is_secondary`[​](/docs/controls/appbar#is_secondary "Direct link to is_secondary")

Whether this app bar is not being displayed at the top of the screen.

Value is of type `bool` and defaults to `False`.

### `leading`[​](/docs/controls/appbar#leading "Direct link to leading")

A `Control` to display before the toolbar's title.

Typically the leading control is an [`Icon`](/docs/controls/icon) or an [`IconButton`](/docs/controls/iconbutton).

Value is of type `Control`.

### `leading_width`[​](/docs/controls/appbar#leading_width "Direct link to leading_width")

Defines the width of leading control.

Value is of type [`OptionalNumber`](/docs/reference/types/aliases#optionalnumber) and defaults to `56.0`.

### `shadow_color`[​](/docs/controls/appbar#shadow_color "Direct link to shadow_color")

The [color](/docs/reference/colors) of the shadow below the app bar.

A shadow is only visible and displayed if the `elevation` is greater than zero.

### `shape`[​](/docs/controls/appbar#shape "Direct link to shape")

The shape of the app bar's Material as well as its shadow.

Value is of type [`OutlinedBorder`](/docs/reference/types/outlinedborder).

### `surface_tint_color`[​](/docs/controls/appbar#surface_tint_color "Direct link to surface_tint_color")

The color of the surface tint overlay applied to the app bar's `bgcolor` to indicate elevation.

By default, no overlay will be applied.

### `title`[​](/docs/controls/appbar#title "Direct link to title")

The primary `Control` displayed in the app bar. Typically a [`Text`](/docs/controls/text) control that contains a description of the current contents of the app.

**Note** that, if `AppBar.adaptive=True` and the app is opened on an iOS or macOS device, this control will be automatically centered.

Value is of type `Control`.

### `title_spacing`[​](/docs/controls/appbar#title_spacing "Direct link to title_spacing")

The spacing around `title` on the horizontal axis. It is applied even if there are no `leading` or `actions` controls.

If you want `title` to take all the space available, set this value to `0.0`.

Value is of type [`OptionalNumber`](/docs/reference/types/aliases#optionalnumber).

### `title_text_style`[​](/docs/controls/appbar#title_text_style "Direct link to title_text_style")

The style to be used for the `Text` controls in the `title`.

Value is of type [`TextStyle`](/docs/reference/types/textstyle).

### `toolbar_height`[​](/docs/controls/appbar#toolbar_height "Direct link to toolbar_height")

Defines the height of the toolbar component of an AppBar.

Value is of tye [`OptionalNumber`](/docs/reference/types/aliases#optionalnumber) and defaults to `56.0`.

### `toolbar_opacity`[​](/docs/controls/appbar#toolbar_opacity "Direct link to toolbar_opacity")

The opacity of the toolbar. Value ranges from `0.0` (transparent) to `1.0` (fully opaque).

Value is of type [`OptionalNumber`](/docs/reference/types/aliases#optionalnumber) and defaults to `1.0`.

### `toolbar_text_style`[​](/docs/controls/appbar#toolbar_text_style "Direct link to toolbar_text_style")

The style to be used for the `Text` controls in the app bar's `leading` and `actions` (but not `title`).

Value is of type [`TextStyle`](/docs/reference/types/textstyle).

-   Python

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    page.theme_mode = ft.ThemeMode.LIGHT    page.appbar = ft.CupertinoAppBar(        leading=ft.Icon(ft.Icons.PALETTE),        bgcolor=ft.Colors.SURFACE_CONTAINER_HIGHEST,        trailing=ft.Icon(ft.Icons.WB_SUNNY_OUTLINED),      middle=ft.Text("CupertinoAppBar Example"),    )    page.add(ft.Text("Body!"))ft.app(main)
```

![](https://flet.dev/docs/controls/cupertinoappbar/img/docs/controls/cupertino-appbar/cupertino-appbar.png)

## Properties[​](/docs/controls/cupertinoappbar#properties "Direct link to Properties")

### `automatic_background_visibility`[​](/docs/controls/cupertinoappbar#automatic_background_visibility "Direct link to automatic_background_visibility")

Whether the navigation bar should appear transparent when content is scrolled under it.

If `False`, the navigation bar will display its `bgcolor`.

Defaults to `True`.

### `automatically_imply_leading`[​](/docs/controls/cupertinoappbar#automatically_imply_leading "Direct link to automatically_imply_leading")

Controls whether we should try to imply the leading control if None.

If `True` and `leading` is null, automatically try to deduce what the leading widget should be. If `False` and `leading` is None, leading space is given to title. If leading widget is not None, this parameter has no effect.

### `automatically_imply_middle`[​](/docs/controls/cupertinoappbar#automatically_imply_middle "Direct link to automatically_imply_middle")

Controls whether we should try to imply the middle control if None.

If `True` and `middle` is null, automatically fill in a Text control with the current route's title. If middle control is not None, this parameter has no effect.

### `bgcolor`[​](/docs/controls/cupertinoappbar#bgcolor "Direct link to bgcolor")

The fill [color](/docs/reference/colors) to use for an AppBar. Default color is defined by current theme.

### `border`[​](/docs/controls/cupertinoappbar#border "Direct link to border")

The border of the app bar. By default, a single pixel bottom border side is rendered.

Value is of type [`Border`](/docs/reference/types/border).

### `brightness`[​](/docs/controls/cupertinoappbar#brightness "Direct link to brightness")

The brightness of the specified `bgcolor`.

Setting this value changes the style of the system status bar. It is typically used to increase the contrast ratio of the system status bar over `bgcolor`.

If `None` (the default), it's value will be inferred from the relative luminance of the `bgcolor`.

Value is of type [`Brightness`](/docs/reference/types/brightness).

### `elevation`[​](/docs/controls/cupertinoappbar#elevation "Direct link to elevation")

This property controls the size of the shadow below the app bar.

Defaults to `4`.

### `enable_background_filter_blur`[​](/docs/controls/cupertinoappbar#enable_background_filter_blur "Direct link to enable_background_filter_blur")

Whether to have a blur effect when a non-opaque `bgcolor` is used.

This will only be respected when `automatic_background_visibility` is `False` or until content scrolls under the navbar.

Defaults to `True`.

### `leading`[​](/docs/controls/cupertinoappbar#leading "Direct link to leading")

A `Control` to display at the start of this app bar. Typically the leading control is an [`Icon`](/docs/controls/icon) or an [`IconButton`](/docs/controls/iconbutton).

If `None` and `automatically_imply_leading = True`, an appropriate button will be automatically created.

### `middle`[​](/docs/controls/cupertinoappbar#middle "Direct link to middle")

A `Control` to display in the middle of this app bar. Typically a [`Text`](/docs/controls/text) or a segmented control.

Defines the padding for the contents of the app bar.

Padding is an instance of [`Padding`](/docs/reference/types/padding) class.

If `None`, the app bar will adopt the following defaults:

-   vertically, contents will be sized to the same height as the app bar itself minus the status bar.
-   horizontally, padding will be `16` pixels according to iOS specifications unless the leading widget is an automatically inserted back button, in which case the padding will be `0`.

Vertical padding won't change the height of the app bar.

### `trailing`[​](/docs/controls/cupertinoappbar#trailing "Direct link to trailing")

A Control to place at the end of the app bar. Normally additional actions taken on the page such as a search or edit function.

# MenuBar

A menu bar that manages cascading child menus.

It could be placed anywhere but typically resides above the main body of the application and defines a menu system for invoking callbacks in response to user selection of a menu item.

Value is of type [`OutlinedBorder`](/docs/reference/types/outlinedborder).

### `label_behavior`[​](/docs/controls/navigationbar#label_behavior "Direct link to label_behavior")

Defines how the destinations' labels will be laid out and when they'll be displayed.

Can be used to show all labels, show only the selected label, or hide all labels.

Value is of type [`NavigationBarLabelBehavior`](/docs/reference/types/navigationbarlabelbehavior) and defaults to `NavigationBarLabelBehavior.ALWAYS_SHOW`.

### `overlay_color`[​](/docs/controls/navigationbar#overlay_color "Direct link to overlay_color")

Example with Control:

```
icon=ft.Icon(ft.Icons.BOOKMARK)
```

If `selected_icon` is provided, this will only be displayed when the destination is not selected.

To make the NavigationBar more accessible, consider choosing an icon with a stroked and filled version, such as `ft.Icons.CLOUD` and `ft.Icons.CLOUD_QUEUE`. The icon should be set to the stroked version and `selected_icon` to the filled version.

### `icon_content`[​](/docs/controls/navigationbar#icon_content "Direct link to icon_content")

The icon `Control` of the destination. Typically the icon is an [`Icon`](/docs/controls/icon) control. Used instead of `icon` property.

```

Example with Control:

```
selected_icon=ft.Icon(ft.Icons.BOOKMARK)
```

If this icon is not provided, the NavigationBar will display `icon` in either state.

### `selected_icon_content`[​](/docs/controls/navigationbar#selected_icon_content "Direct link to selected_icon_content")

An alternative icon `Control` displayed when this destination is selected.

# NavigationDrawer

Material Design Navigation Drawer component.

Navigation Drawer is a panel that slides in horizontally from the left or right edge of a page to show primary destinations in an app. To add NavigationDrawer to the page, use [`page.drawer`](/docs/controls/page#drawer) and [`page.end_drawer`](/docs/controls/page#end_drawer) properties. Similarly, the NavigationDrawer can be added to a [`View`](/docs/controls/view#drawer). To display the drawer, set its `open` property to `True`.

To open this control, simply call the [`page.open()`](/docs/controls/page#opencontrol) helper-method.

Defaults to `False`.

### `group_alignment`[​](/docs/controls/navigationrail#group_alignment "Direct link to group_alignment")

The vertical alignment for the group of destinations within the rail.

The NavigationRailDestinations are grouped together with the trailing widget, between the leading widget and the bottom of the rail.

The value must be between `-1.0` and `1.0`.

If `group_alignment` is `-1.0`, then the items are aligned to the top. If `group_alignment` is `0.0`, then the items are aligned to the center. If `group_alignment` is `1.0`, then the items are aligned to the bottom.

Defaults to `-1.0`.

Value is of type [`OutlinedBorder`](/docs/reference/types/outlinedborder) and defaults to `StadiumBorder()`.

### `label_type`[​](/docs/controls/navigationrail#label_type "Direct link to label_type")

Defines the layout and behavior of the labels for the default, unextended navigation rail.

When a navigation rail is extended, the labels are always shown.

Value is of type [`NavigationRailLabelType`](/docs/reference/types/navigationraillabeltype) and defaults to `None` - no labels are shown.

### `leading`[​](/docs/controls/navigationrail#leading "Direct link to leading")

An optional leading control in the rail that is placed above the destinations.

Its location is not affected by `group_alignment`.

This is commonly a [`FloatingActionButton`](/docs/controls/floatingactionbutton), but may also be a non-button, such as a logo.

### `min_extended_width`[​](/docs/controls/navigationrail#min_extended_width "Direct link to min_extended_width")

The final width when the animation is complete for setting `extended` to `True`.

Defaults to `256`.

### `min_width`[​](/docs/controls/navigationrail#min_width "Direct link to min_width")

The smallest possible width for the rail regardless of the destination's icon or label size.

Defaults to `72`.

This value also defines the min width and min height of the destinations.

To make a compact rail, set this to `56` and use `label_type='none'`.

### `selected_index`[​](/docs/controls/navigationrail#selected_index "Direct link to selected_index")

The index into `destinations` for the current selected `NavigationRailDestination` or `None` if no destination is selected.

### `selected_label_text_style`[​](/docs/controls/navigationrail#selected_label_text_style "Direct link to selected_label_text_style")

The [`TextStyle`](/docs/reference/types/textstyle) of a destination's label when it is selected.

When a destination is not selected, `unselected_label_text_style` will instead be used.

### `trailing`[​](/docs/controls/navigationrail#trailing "Direct link to trailing")

An optional trailing control in the rail that is placed below the destinations.

Its location is affected by `group_alignment`.

This is commonly a list of additional options or destinations that is usually only rendered when `extended=True`.

### `unselected_label_text_style`[​](/docs/controls/navigationrail#unselected_label_text_style "Direct link to unselected_label_text_style")

The [`TextStyle`](/docs/reference/types/textstyle) of a destination's label when it is not selected.

When a destination is selected, `selected_label_text_style` will instead be used.

## `NavigationRail` events[​](/docs/controls/navigationrail#navigationrail-events "Direct link to navigationrail-events")

### `on_change`[​](/docs/controls/navigationrail#on_change "Direct link to on_change")

The [name of the icon](/docs/reference/icons) or `Control` of the destination. Example with icon name:

```
icon=ft.Icons.BOOKMARK
```

Example with Control:

```
icon=ft.Icon(ft.Icons.BOOKMARK)
```

If `selected_icon` is provided, this will only be displayed when the destination is not selected.

To make the NavigationRail more accessible, consider choosing an icon with a stroked and filled version, such as `ft.Icons.CLOUD` and `ft.Icons.CLOUD_QUEUE`. The icon should be set to the stroked version and `selected_icon` to the filled version.

### `icon_content`[​](/docs/controls/navigationrail#icon_content "Direct link to icon_content")

The icon `Control` of the destination. Typically the icon is an [`Icon`](/docs/controls/icon) control. Used instead of `icon` property.

**Deprecated in v0.25.0 and will be removed in v0.28.0. Use [`icon`](/docs/controls/navigationrail#icon) instead.**

### `indicator_color`[​](/docs/controls/navigationrail#indicator_color-1 "Direct link to indicator_color-1")

The [color](/docs/reference/colors) of the `indicator_shape` when this destination is selected.

### `indicator_shape`[​](/docs/controls/navigationrail#indicator_shape-1 "Direct link to indicator_shape-1")

The shape of the selection indicator. The value is an instance of [`OutlinedBorder`](/docs/reference/types/outlinedborder) class.

### `label`[​](/docs/controls/navigationrail#label "Direct link to label")

A string representing the destination's label. Will be displayed only if `label_content` is not provided.

### `label_content`[​](/docs/controls/navigationrail#label_content "Direct link to label_content")

The label `Control` for the destination. If this is provided, then `label` will be ignored.

### `padding`[​](/docs/controls/navigationrail#padding "Direct link to padding")

The amount of space to inset the destination item.

Padding is an instance of [`Padding`](/docs/reference/types/padding) class.

### `selected_icon`[​](/docs/controls/navigationrail#selected_icon "Direct link to selected_icon")

The [name](/docs/reference/icons) of alternative icon or `Control` displayed when this destination is selected.

Example with icon name:

```
selected_icon=ft.Icons.BOOKMARK
```

Example with Control:

# Ads

Displays ads in your app. Only available for mobile (Android and iOS) platforms.

Packaging

To build your Flet app that uses ads control add `--include-packages flet_ads` to `flet build` command, for example:

```
flet build apk --include-packages flet_ads
```

## Examples[​](/docs/controls/ads#examples "Direct link to Examples")

-   Python

```
import flet as ftimport flet.ads as adsdef main(page: ft.Page):    page.horizontal_alignment = ft.CrossAxisAlignment.CENTER    id_interstitial = (        "ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/1033173712"        if page.platform == ft.PagePlatform.ANDROID        else "ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/4411468910"    )    id_banner = (        "ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/6300978111"        if page.platform == ft.PagePlatform.ANDROID        else "ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/2934735716"    )    def handle_interstitial_close(e):        nonlocal iad        print("InterstitialAd closed")        page.overlay.remove(e.control)        page.overlay.append(iad := get_new_interstitial_ad())        page.update()    def get_new_interstitial_ad():        return ads.InterstitialAd(            unit_id=id_interstitial,            on_load=lambda e: print("InterstitialAd loaded"),            on_error=lambda e: print("InterstitialAd error", e.data),            on_open=lambda e: print("InterstitialAd opened"),            on_close=handle_interstitial_close,            on_impression=lambda e: print("InterstitialAd impression"),            on_click=lambda e: print("InterstitialAd clicked"),        )    def display_new_banner_ad():        page.add(            ft.Container(                content=ads.BannerAd(                    unit_id=id_banner,                    on_click=lambda e: print("BannerAd clicked"),                    on_load=lambda e: print("BannerAd loaded"),                    on_error=lambda e: print("BannerAd error", e.data),                    on_open=lambda e: print("BannerAd opened"),                    on_close=lambda e: print("BannerAd closed"),                    on_impression=lambda e: print("BannerAd impression"),                    on_will_dismiss=lambda e: print("BannerAd will dismiss"),                ),                width=320,                height=50,                bgcolor=ft.colors.TRANSPARENT,            )        )    page.overlay.append(iad := get_new_interstitial_ad())    page.appbar = ft.AppBar(        adaptive=True,        title=ft.Text("Mobile Ads Playground"),        bgcolor=ft.colors.LIGHT_BLUE_300,    )    page.add(        ft.OutlinedButton("Show InterstitialAd", on_click=lambda e: iad.show()),        ft.OutlinedButton("Show BannerAd", on_click=lambda e: display_new_banner_ad()),    )ft.app(main)

## Test Values[​](/docs/controls/ads#test-values "Direct link to Test Values")

AdMob [provides](https://developers.google.com/admob/flutter/banner#always_test_with_test_ads) app and ad unit IDs for testing purposes.

-   AdMob app ID: `"ca-app-pub-3940256099942544~3347511713"`
-   `BannerAd.unit_id` on Android: `"ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/9214589741"`
-   `BannerAd.unit_id` on iOS: `"ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/2435281174"`
-   `InterstitialAd.unit_id` on Android: `"ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/1033173712"`
-   `InterstitialAd.unit_id` on iOS: `"ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/4411468910"`

Remember to replace these values with your own when you're ready to package your app.

## Packaging[​](/docs/controls/ads#packaging "Direct link to Packaging")

The following are to be done when packaging an app that makes use of one of the above ad controls.

### Include Ads package[​](/docs/controls/ads#include-ads-package "Direct link to Include Ads package")

Add `--include-packages flet_ads` to the `flet build` command, for example:

```
flet build apk --include-packages flet_ads
```

### Specify AdMob app ID[​](/docs/controls/ads#specify-admob-app-id "Direct link to Specify AdMob app ID")

Specify your [AdMob app ID](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/7356431), without which your application might crash on launch.

You can specify the app ID in two ways:

-   In your `pyproject.toml` file:

```
# for Android[tool.flet.android.meta_data]"com.google.android.gms.ads.APPLICATION_ID" = "ca-app-pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx~yyyyyyyyyy"# for iOS[tool.flet.ios.info]GADApplicationIdentifier = "ca-app-pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx~yyyyyyyyyy"
```

-   In your build command from the terminal:

```
# for Androidflet build apk ... --android-meta-data com.google.android.gms.ads.APPLICATION_ID=ca-app-pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx~yyyyyyyyyy# for iOSflet build ipa ... --info-plist GADApplicationIdentifier=ca-app-pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx~yyyyyyyyyy
```

# BannerAd

Rectangular ads that appear at the top or bottom of the device screen. Banner ads stay on screen while users are interacting with the app, and can refresh automatically after a certain period of time.

See [this](/docs/controls/ads) for more information.

note

For enhanced app performance, it is recommended dispose (remove from the controls tree) any `BannerAd` control after it is no longer needed.

On iOS, make sure you place this ad in a control with a fixed width and height, otherwise your ad may not be displayed. See [this](https://developers.google.com/admob/flutter/banner/fixed-size) for more information on standard banner sizes.

# InterstitialAd

Full-screen ads that cover the interface of an app until closed by the user. They're best used at natural pauses in the flow of an app's execution, such as in between levels of a game or just after completing a task.

See [this](/docs/controls/ads) for more information.

## Properties[​](/docs/controls/interstitialad#properties "Direct link to Properties")

### `unit_id`[​](/docs/controls/interstitialad#unit_id "Direct link to unit_id")

The ad unit ID to be used for the ad.

## Methods[​](/docs/controls/interstitialad#methods "Direct link to Methods")

### `show()`[​](/docs/controls/interstitialad#show "Direct link to show")

Shows the interstitial ad. The interstitial ad must be added to the [`page.overlay`](/docs/controls/page#overlay) before calling this method.

note

Interstitial ads require user input to be dismissed. They can't be dismissed programmatically.

Also, interstitial ads can only be shown once. Subsequent calls to show will trigger `on_error`. To show an `InterstitialAd` again, you need to create a new instance. ([example](/docs/controls/ads#examples))

## Events[​](/docs/controls/interstitialad#events "Direct link to Events")

### `on_click`[​](/docs/controls/interstitialad#on_click "Direct link to on_click")

Fires when the ad is clicked.

### `on_close`[​](/docs/controls/interstitialad#on_close "Direct link to on_close")

Fires when the full screen view has been closed.

You can resume anything paused while handling `on_open`.

### `on_error`[​](/docs/controls/interstitialad#on_error "Direct link to on_error")

Fires when an error occurs on the ad.

### `on_impression`[​](/docs/controls/interstitialad#on_impression "Direct link to on_impression")

Fires when an impression occurs on the ad.

### `on_load`[​](/docs/controls/interstitialad#on_load "Direct link to on_load")

Fires when the ad is loaded.

### `on_open`[​](/docs/controls/interstitialad#on_open "Direct link to on_open")

Fires when the ad is clicked. A full screen view/overlay (e.g. a browser window) is presented in response to the user clicking on an ad.

You may want to pause animations and time sensitive interactions.

On this page

# CircleAvatar

A circle that represents a user.

Typically used with a user's profile image, or, in the absence of such an image, the user's initials. A given user's initials should always be paired with the same background color, for consistency.

If `foreground_image_src` fails then `background_image_src` is used. If `background_image_src` fails too, `bgcolor` is used.

## Examples[​](/docs/controls/circleavatar#examples "Direct link to Examples")

[Live example](https://flet-controls-gallery.fly.dev/displays/circleavatar)

-   Python

```
import flet as ftdef main(page):    # a "normal" avatar with background image    a1 = ft.CircleAvatar(        foreground_image_src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5041459?s=88&v=4",        content=ft.Text("FF"),    )    # avatar with failing foreground image and fallback text    a2 = ft.CircleAvatar(        foreground_image_src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/_5041459?s=88&v=4",        content=ft.Text("FF"),    )    # avatar with icon, aka icon with inverse background    a3 = ft.CircleAvatar(        content=ft.Icon(ft.Icons.ABC),    )    # avatar with icon and custom colors    a4 = ft.CircleAvatar(        content=ft.Icon(ft.Icons.WARNING_ROUNDED),        color=ft.Colors.YELLOW_200,        bgcolor=ft.Colors.AMBER_700,    )    # avatar with online status    a5 = ft.Stack(        [            ft.CircleAvatar(                foreground_image_src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5041459?s=88&v=4"            ),            ft.Container(                content=ft.CircleAvatar(bgcolor=ft.Colors.GREEN, radius=5),                alignment=ft.alignment.bottom_left,            ),        ],        width=40,        height=40,    )    page.add(a1, a2, a3, a4, a5)ft.app(main)
```

## Properties[​](/docs/controls/circleavatar#properties "Direct link to Properties")

### `background_image_src`[​](/docs/controls/circleavatar#background_image_src "Direct link to background_image_src")

The source (local asset file or URL) of the background image in the circle. Changing the background image will cause the avatar to animate to the new image. Typically used as a fallback image for `foreground_image_src`. If the CircleAvatar is to have the user's initials, use `content` instead.

### `bgcolor`[​](/docs/controls/circleavatar#bgcolor "Direct link to bgcolor")

The [color](/docs/reference/colors) with which to fill the circle. Changing the background color will cause the avatar to animate to the new color.

### `color`[​](/docs/controls/circleavatar#color "Direct link to color")

The default text [color](/docs/reference/colors) for text in the circle. Defaults to the primary text theme color if no `bgcolor` is specified.

### `content`[​](/docs/controls/circleavatar#content "Direct link to content")

Typically a `Text` control. If the CircleAvatar is to have an image, use `background_image_src` instead.

### `foreground_image_src`[​](/docs/controls/circleavatar#foreground_image_src "Direct link to foreground_image_src")

The source (local asset file or URL) of the foreground image in the circle. Typically used as profile image. For fallback use `background_image_src`.

### `max_radius`[​](/docs/controls/circleavatar#max_radius "Direct link to max_radius")

The maximum size of the avatar, expressed as the radius (half the diameter). If maxRadius is specified, then radius must not also be specified. Defaults to "infinity".

### `min_radius`[​](/docs/controls/circleavatar#min_radius "Direct link to min_radius")

The minimum size of the avatar, expressed as the radius (half the diameter). If minRadius is specified, then radius must not also be specified. Defaults to zero.

### `radius`[​](/docs/controls/circleavatar#radius "Direct link to radius")

The size of the avatar, expressed as the radius (half the diameter). If radius is specified, then neither minRadius nor maxRadius may be specified.

### `tooltip`[​](/docs/controls/circleavatar#tooltip "Direct link to tooltip")

The text displayed when hovering the mouse over the button.

## Events[​](/docs/controls/circleavatar#events "Direct link to Events")

### `on_image_error`[​](/docs/controls/circleavatar#on_image_error "Direct link to on_image_error")

Fires when an error occurs while loading the `background_image_src` or `foreground_image_src`.

The event data (`e.data`) is a string whose value is either `"background"` or `"foreground"` indicating the error's origin.

# Image

An image is a graphic representation of something (e.g photo or illustration).

## Examples[​](/docs/controls/image#examples "Direct link to Examples")

[Live example](https://flet-controls-gallery.fly.dev/displays/image)

-   Python

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    page.title = "Images Example"    page.theme_mode = ft.ThemeMode.LIGHT    page.padding = 50    page.update()    img = ft.Image(        src=f"/icons/icon-512.png",        width=100,        height=100,        fit=ft.ImageFit.CONTAIN,    )    images = ft.Row(expand=1, wrap=False, scroll="always")    page.add(img, images)    for i in range(0, 30):        images.controls.append(            ft.Image(                src=f"https://picsum.photos/200/200?{i}",                width=200,                height=200,                fit=ft.ImageFit.NONE,                repeat=ft.ImageRepeat.NO_REPEAT,                border_radius=ft.border_radius.all(10),            )        )    page.update()ft.app(main)
```

## Properties[​](/docs/controls/image#properties "Direct link to Properties")

### `anti_alias`[​](/docs/controls/image#anti_alias "Direct link to anti_alias")

Whether to paint the image with anti-aliasing.

Anti-aliasing alleviates the sawtooth artifact when the image is rotated.

### `border_radius`[​](/docs/controls/image#border_radius "Direct link to border_radius")

Clip image to have rounded corners.

Value is of type [`BorderRadius`](/docs/reference/types/borderradius).

### `cache_width`[​](/docs/controls/image#cache_width "Direct link to cache_width")

The size at which the image should be decoded.

The image will, however, be rendered to the constraints of the layout regardless of this parameter.

### `cache_height`[​](/docs/controls/image#cache_height "Direct link to cache_height")

The size at which the image should be decoded.

The image will, however, be rendered to the constraints of the layout regardless of this parameter.

### `color`[​](/docs/controls/image#color "Direct link to color")

If set, this [color](/docs/reference/colors) is blended with each image pixel using `color_blend_mode`.

### `color_blend_mode`[​](/docs/controls/image#color_blend_mode "Direct link to color_blend_mode")

Used to combine `color` with the image. In terms of the blend mode, color is the source and this image is the destination.

Value is of type [`BlendMode`](/docs/reference/types/blendmode) and defaults to `BlendMode.COLOR`.

### `error_content`[​](/docs/controls/image#error_content "Direct link to error_content")

Fallback `Control` to display if the image cannot be loaded from the source.

### `exclude_from_semantics`[​](/docs/controls/image#exclude_from_semantics "Direct link to exclude_from_semantics")

Whether to exclude this image from semantics.

Defaults to `False`.

### `filter_quality`[​](/docs/controls/image#filter_quality "Direct link to filter_quality")

The rendering quality of the image.

Value is of type [`FilterQuality`](/docs/reference/types/filterquality) and defaults to `FilterQuality.MEDIUM`.

### `fit`[​](/docs/controls/image#fit "Direct link to fit")

How to inscribe the image into the space allocated during layout.

Value is of type [`ImageFit`](/docs/reference/types/imagefit) and defaults to `ImageFit.NONE`.

### `gapless_playback`[​](/docs/controls/image#gapless_playback "Direct link to gapless_playback")

Whether to continue showing the old image (`True`), or briefly show nothing (`False`), when the image provider changes.

Defaults to `False`.

### `height`[​](/docs/controls/image#height "Direct link to height")

If set, require the image to have this height.

If not set, the image will pick a size that best preserves its intrinsic aspect ratio.

note

It is strongly recommended that either both the width and the height be specified, or that the Image be placed in a context that sets tight layout constraints, so that the image does not change size as it loads. Consider using `fit` to adapt the image's rendering to fit the given width and height if the exact image dimensions are not known in advance.

### `semantics_label`[​](/docs/controls/image#semantics_label "Direct link to semantics_label")

A semantic description of the image. Used to provide a description of the image to TalkBack on Android, and VoiceOver on iOS.

### `src`[​](/docs/controls/image#src "Direct link to src")

The image source. This could be an external URL or a local [asset file](/docs/cookbook/assets).

### `src_base64`[​](/docs/controls/image#src_base64 "Direct link to src_base64")

Displays an image from Base-64 encoded string, for example:

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    page.add(ft.Image(src_base64="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"))ft.app(main)
```

Use `base64` command (Linux, macOS, WSL) to convert file to Base64 format, for example:

```
base64 -i <image.png> -o <image-base64.txt>
```

On Windows you can use PowerShell to encode string into Base64 format:

```
[convert]::ToBase64String((Get-Content -path "your_file_path" -Encoding byte))
```

### `repeat`[​](/docs/controls/image#repeat "Direct link to repeat")

How to paint any portions of the layout bounds not covered by the image.

Values is of type [`ImageRepeat`](/docs/reference/types/imagerepeat) and defaults to `ImageRepeat.NO_REPEAT`.

# Map

Used to display a map with various layers.

Packaging

To build your Flet app that uses `Map` control add `--include-packages flet_map` to `flet build` command, for example:

```
flet build apk --include-packages flet_map
```

# ProgressBar

A material design linear progress indicator, also known as a progress bar.

A control that shows progress along a line.

There are two kinds of linear progress indicators:

-   *Determinate*. Determinate progress indicators have a specific value at each point in time, and the value should increase monotonically from `0.0` to `1.0`, at which time the indicator is complete. To create a determinate progress indicator, use a non-null value between `0.0` and `1.0`.
-   *Indeterminate*. Indeterminate progress indicators do not have a specific value at each point in time and instead indicate that progress is being made without indicating how much progress remains. To create an indeterminate progress indicator, use a null value.

## Examples[​](/docs/controls/progressbar#examples "Direct link to Examples")

[Live example](https://flet-controls-gallery.fly.dev/displays/progressbar)

-   Python

```
from time import sleepimport flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    pb = ft.ProgressBar(width=400)    page.add(        ft.Text("Linear progress indicator", style="headlineSmall"),        ft.Column([ ft.Text("Doing something..."), pb]),        ft.Text("Indeterminate progress bar", style="headlineSmall"),        ft.ProgressBar(width=400, color="amber", bgcolor="#eeeeee"),    )    for i in range(0, 101):        pb.value = i * 0.01        sleep(0.1)        page.update()ft.app(main)
```

## Properties[​](/docs/controls/progressbar#properties "Direct link to Properties")

### `value`[​](/docs/controls/progressbar#value "Direct link to value")

The value of this progress indicator. A value of `0.0` means no progress and `1.0` means that progress is complete. The value will be clamped to be in the range `0.0` - `1.0`.

Defaults to `None`, meaning that this progress indicator is indeterminate - displays a predetermined animation that does not indicate how much actual progress is being made.

### `bar_height`[​](/docs/controls/progressbar#bar_height "Direct link to bar_height")

The minimum height of the line used to draw the linear indicator.

Defaults to `4`.

### `border_radius`[​](/docs/controls/progressbar#border_radius "Direct link to border_radius")

The border radius of both the indicator and the track. Border radius is an instance of [`BorderRadius`](/docs/reference/types/borderradius) class.

Defaults to `border_radius.all(0)` - rectangular shape.

### `bgcolor`[​](/docs/controls/progressbar#bgcolor "Direct link to bgcolor")

[Color](/docs/reference/colors) of the track being filled by the linear indicator.

### `color`[​](/docs/controls/progressbar#color "Direct link to color")

The progress indicator's [color](/docs/reference/colors).

### `semantics_label`[​](/docs/controls/progressbar#semantics_label "Direct link to semantics_label")

The [`Semantics.label`](/docs/controls/semantics#label) for this progress indicator.

### `semantics_value`[​](/docs/controls/progressbar#semantics_value "Direct link to semantics_value")

The [`Semantics.value`](/docs/controls/semantics#value) for this progress indicator.

# ProgressRing

A material design circular progress indicator, which spins to indicate that the application is busy.

A control that shows progress along a circle.

There are two kinds of circular progress indicators:

Elevated buttons are essentially filled tonal buttons with a shadow. To prevent shadow creep, only use them when absolutely necessary, such as when the button requires visual separation from a patterned background. See [Material 3 buttons](https://m3.material.io/components/buttons/overview) for more info.

`ElevatedButton` has alias `Button` that can be used interchangebly.

# FilledButton

Filled buttons have the most visual impact after the [`FloatingActionButton`](/docs/controls/floatingactionbutton), and should be used for important, final actions that complete a flow, like **Save**, **Join now**, or **Confirm**. See [Material 3 buttons](https://m3.material.io/components/buttons/overview) for more info.

# FilledTonalButton

A filled tonal button is an alternative middle ground between [`FilledButton`](/docs/controls/filledbutton) and [`OutlinedButton`](/docs/controls/outlinedbutton) buttons. They’re useful in contexts where a lower-priority button requires slightly more emphasis than an outline would give, such as "Next" in an onboarding flow. Tonal buttons use the secondary color mapping. See [Material 3 buttons](https://m3.material.io/components/buttons/overview) for more info.

# FloatingActionButton

A material design floating action button. A floating action button is a circular icon button that hovers over content to promote a primary action in the application. Floating action button is usually set to `page.floating_action_button`, but can also be added as a regular control at any place on a page.

# OutlinedButton

Outlined buttons are medium-emphasis buttons. They contain actions that are important, but aren’t the primary action in an app. Outlined buttons pair well with filled buttons to indicate an alternative, secondary action. See [Material 3 buttons](https://m3.material.io/components/buttons/overview) for more info.

An `Icon` control that is used to indicate a segment is selected.

If `show_selected_icon` is `True` then for `selected` segments this icon will be shown before the `Segment.label`, replacing the `Segment.icon` if it is specified.

Defaults to an `Icon` with the `CHECK` icon.

### `show_selected_icon`[​](/docs/controls/segmentedbutton#show_selected_icon "Direct link to show_selected_icon")

A boolean value that indicates if the `selected_icon` is displayed on the `selected` segments.

If `True`, the `selected_icon` will be displayed at the start of the `selected` segments.

# Chip

Chips are compact elements that represent an attribute, text, entity, or action.

Chips help people enter information, make selections, filter content, or trigger actions. Use chips to show options for a specific context.

## Examples[​](/docs/controls/chip#examples "Direct link to Examples")

[Live example](https://flet-controls-gallery.fly.dev/input/chip)

### Assist chips[​](/docs/controls/chip#assist-chips "Direct link to Assist chips")

Assist chips are chips with `leading` icon and `on_click` event specified. They represent smart or automated actions that appear dynamically and contextually in a UI.

An alternative to assist chips are buttons, which should appear persistently and consistently.

-   Python

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    def save_to_favorites_clicked(e):        e.control.label.value = "Saved to favorites"        e.control.leading = ft.Icon(ft.Icons.FAVORITE_OUTLINED)        e.control.disabled = True        page.update()    def open_google_maps(e):        page.launch_url("https://maps.google.com")        page.update()    save_to_favourites = ft.Chip(        label=ft.Text("Save to favourites"),        leading=ft.Icon(ft.Icons.FAVORITE_BORDER_OUTLINED),        bgcolor=ft.Colors.GREEN_200,        disabled_color=ft.Colors.GREEN_100,        autofocus=True,        on_click=save_to_favorites_clicked,    )    open_in_maps = ft.Chip(        label=ft.Text("9 min walk"),        leading=ft.Icon(ft.Icons.MAP_SHARP),        bgcolor=ft.Colors.GREEN_200,        on_click=open_google_maps,    )    page.add(ft.Row([save_to_favourites, open_in_maps]))ft.app(main)
```

![](https://flet.dev/docs/controls/chip/img/docs/controls/chip/assist-chips.png)

### Filter chips[​](/docs/controls/chip#filter-chips "Direct link to Filter chips")

Filter chips are chips with `on_select` event specified. They use tags or descriptive words provided in the `label` to filter content. They can be a good alternative to switches or checkboxes.

-   Python

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    def amenity_selected(e):        page.update()    title = ft.Row([ft.Icon(ft.Icons.HOTEL_CLASS), ft.Text("Amenities")])    amenities = ["Washer / Dryer", "Ramp access", "Dogs OK", "Cats OK", "Smoke-free"]    amenity_chips = []    for amenity in amenities:        amenity_chips.append(            ft.Chip(                label=ft.Text(amenity),                bgcolor=ft.Colors.GREEN_200,                disabled_color=ft.Colors.GREEN_100,                autofocus=True,                on_select=amenity_selected,            )        )    page.add(title, ft.Row(amenity_chips))ft.app(main)

# CupertinoSlider

An macOS style slider. It provides a visual indication of adjustable content, as well as the current setting in the total range of content.

Use a slider when you want people to set defined values (such as volume or brightness), or when people would benefit from instant feedback on the effect of setting changes.

# CupertinoSwitch

An iOS-style switch.

Used to toggle the on/off state of a single setting.

A toggle represents a physical switch that allows someone to choose between two mutually exclusive options.

For example, "On/Off", "Show/Hide". Choosing an option should produce an immediate result.

# Slider

A slider provides a visual indication of adjustable content, as well as the current setting in the total range of content.

Use a slider when you want people to set defined values (such as volume or brightness), or when people would benefit from instant feedback on the effect of setting changes.

# AlertDialog

A material design alert dialog.

An alert dialog informs the user about situations that require acknowledgement. An alert dialog has an optional title and an optional list of actions. The title is displayed above the content and the actions are displayed below the content.

To open this control, simply call the [`page.open()`](/docs/controls/page#opencontrol) helper-method.

## Examples[​](/docs/controls/alertdialog#examples "Direct link to Examples")

[Live example](https://flet-controls-gallery.fly.dev/dialogs/alertdialog)

### Basic and modal dialogs[​](/docs/controls/alertdialog#basic-and-modal-dialogs "Direct link to Basic and modal dialogs")

-   Python

### `actions`[​](/docs/controls/alertdialog#actions "Direct link to actions")

The (optional) set of actions that are displayed at the bottom of the dialog.

Typically this is a list of [`TextButton`](/docs/controls/textbutton) controls.

### `action_button_padding`[​](/docs/controls/alertdialog#action_button_padding "Direct link to action_button_padding")

The padding that surrounds each button in `actions`.

Value is of type [`PaddingValue`](/docs/reference/types/aliases#paddingvalue).

### `actions_alignment`[​](/docs/controls/alertdialog#actions_alignment "Direct link to actions_alignment")

Defines the horizontal layout of the actions.

Value is of type [`MainAxisAlignment`](/docs/reference/types/mainaxisalignment) and defaults to `MainAxisAlignment.END`.

### `actions_padding`[​](/docs/controls/alertdialog#actions_padding "Direct link to actions_padding")

Padding around the set of actions at the bottom of the dialog.

Typically used to provide padding to the button bar between the button bar and the edges of the dialog.

# Banner

A banner displays an important, succinct message, and provides actions for users to address (or dismiss the banner). A user action is required for it to be dismissed.

Banners are displayed at the top of the screen, below a top app bar. They are persistent and non-modal, allowing the user to either ignore them or interact with them at any time.

To open this control, simply call the [`page.open()`](/docs/controls/page#opencontrol) helper-method.

# CupertinoAlertDialog

An iOS-style alert dialog.

An alert dialog informs the user about situations that require acknowledgement. An alert dialog has an optional title and an optional list of actions. The title is displayed above the content and the actions are displayed below the content.

This dialog styles its title and content (typically a message) to match the standard iOS title and message dialog text style. These default styles can be overridden by explicitly defining `text_style` property.

To open this control, simply call the [`page.open()`](/docs/controls/page#opencontrol) helper-method.

To display action buttons that look like standard iOS dialog buttons, provide [`CupertinoDialogAction`](/docs/controls/cupertinodialogaction)s for the actions given to this dialog.

## Examples[​](/docs/controls/cupertinodatepicker#examples "Direct link to Examples")

[Live example](https://flet-controls-gallery.fly.dev/dialogs/cupertinodatepicker)

### Basic Example[​](/docs/controls/cupertinodatepicker#basic-example "Direct link to Basic Example")

-   Python

```
import flet as ftdef main(page):    page.horizontal_alignment = ft.CrossAxisAlignment.CENTER    def handle_date_change(e: ft.ControlEvent):        page.add(ft.Text(f"Date changed: {e.control.value.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M %p')}"))    cupertino_date_picker = ft.CupertinoDatePicker(        date_picker_mode=ft.CupertinoDatePickerMode.DATE_AND_TIME,        on_change=handle_date_change,    )    page.add(        ft.CupertinoFilledButton(            "Open CupertinoDatePicker",            on_click=lambda e: page.open(                ft.CupertinoBottomSheet(                    cupertino_date_picker,                    height=216,                    padding=ft.padding.only(top=6),                )            ),        )    )ft.app(main)
```

![](https://flet.dev/docs/controls/cupertinodatepicker/img/docs/controls/cupertino-date-picker/basic-cupertino-date-picker.png)

## Properties[​](/docs/controls/cupertinodatepicker#properties "Direct link to Properties")

### `bgcolor`[​](/docs/controls/cupertinodatepicker#bgcolor "Direct link to bgcolor")

The background [color](/docs/reference/colors) of the date picker.

### `date_order`[​](/docs/controls/cupertinodatepicker#date_order "Direct link to date_order")

The order in which the columns inside this picker are displayed.

Value is of type [`CupertinoDatePickerDateOrder`](/docs/reference/types/cupertinodatepickerdateorder).

note

The final order in which the columns are displayed is also influenced by the `date_picker_mode`. For example, when using `date_picker_mode=CupertinoDatePickerMode.MONTH_YEAR`, both `CupertinoDatePickerDateOrder.DAY_MONTH_YEAR` and `CupertinoDatePickerDateOrder.MONTH_DAY_YEAR` will result in the month|year order.

### `date_picker_mode`[​](/docs/controls/cupertinodatepicker#date_picker_mode "Direct link to date_picker_mode")

The mode of the date picker.

Value is of type [`CupertinoDatePickerMode`](/docs/reference/types/cupertinodatepickermode) and defaults to `CupertinoDatePickerMode.DATE_AND_TIME`.

### `first_date`[​](/docs/controls/cupertinodatepicker#first_date "Direct link to first_date")

The earliest allowable date that the user can select.

Defaults to `None` - no limit.

When not `None`, one can still scroll the picker to dates earlier than `first_date`, with the exception that the `on_change` will not be called. Once let go, the picker will scroll back to `first_date`.

In `CupertinoDatePickerMode.TIME` mode, a time becomes unselectable if the datetime produced by combining that particular time and the date part of initialDateTime is earlier than `last_date`. So typically `first_date` needs to be set to a datetime that is on the same date as initialDateTime.

### `item_extent`[​](/docs/controls/cupertinodatepicker#item_extent "Direct link to item_extent")

The uniform height of all children.

Defaults to `32`.

### `last_date`[​](/docs/controls/cupertinodatepicker#last_date "Direct link to last_date")

The latest allowable date that the user can select.

When not `None`, one can still scroll the picker to dates later than `last_date`, with the exception that the `on_change` will not be called. Once let go, the picker will scroll back to `last_date`.

In `CupertinoDatePickerMode.TIME` mode, a time becomes unselectable if the datetime produced by combining that particular time and the date part of initialDateTime is later than `last_date`. So typically `last_date` needs to be set to a datetime that is on the same date as initialDateTime.

Defaults to `None` - no limit.

### `max_year`[​](/docs/controls/cupertinodatepicker#max_year "Direct link to max_year")

Maximum year to which the picker can be scrolled when in `CupertinoDatePickerMode.DATE` mode.

Defaults to `1`. Defaults to `None` - no limit.

### `min_year`[​](/docs/controls/cupertinodatepicker#min_year "Direct link to min_year")

Minimum year to which the picker can be scrolled when in `CupertinoDatePickerMode.DATE` mode.

Defaults to `1`.

### `min_interval`[​](/docs/controls/cupertinodatepicker#min_interval "Direct link to min_interval")

The granularity of the minutes spinner, if it is shown in the current `date_picker_mode`. Must be an integer factor of 60.

Defaults to `1`.

### `show_day_of_week`[​](/docs/controls/cupertinodatepicker#show_day_of_week "Direct link to show_day_of_week")

Whether to to show day of week alongside day.

Defaults to `False`.

### `use_24h_format`[​](/docs/controls/cupertinodatepicker#use_24h_format "Direct link to use_24h_format")

If `True`, 24-hour time format is used else 12-hour time format is used.

Defaults to `False`.

### `value`[​](/docs/controls/cupertinodatepicker#value "Direct link to value")

The initial date and/or time of the picker. It must conform to the intervals set in `first_date`, `last_date`, `min_year`, and `max_year` else an error will be `ValueError` will be raised.

Defaults to the present date and time.

## Events[​](/docs/controls/cupertinodatepicker#events "Direct link to Events")

### `on_change`[​](/docs/controls/cupertinodatepicker#on_change "Direct link to on_change")

Fires when the selected date and/or time changes. Will not fire if the new selected value is not valid, or is not in the range of `first_date` and `last_date`.

Defaults to `False`.

### `magnification`[​](/docs/controls/cupertinopicker#magnification "Direct link to magnification")

The zoomed-in rate of the magnifier, if it is used.

If the value is greater than `1.0`, the item in the center will be zoomed in by that rate, and it will also be rendered as flat, not cylindrical like the rest of the list. The item will be zoomed-out if magnification less than `1.0`.

Defaults to `1.0` - normal.

### `off_axis_fraction`[​](/docs/controls/cupertinopicker#off_axis_fraction "Direct link to off_axis_fraction")

### `selection_overlay`[​](/docs/controls/cupertinopicker#selection_overlay "Direct link to selection_overlay")

A control overlaid on the picker to highlight the selected entry, centered and matching the height of the center row.

Defaults to a rounded rectangle in iOS 14 style with `default_selection_overlay_bgcolor` as background color.

### `squeeze`[​](/docs/controls/cupertinopicker#squeeze "Direct link to squeeze")

The angular compactness of the children on the wheel.

### `use_magnifier`[​](/docs/controls/cupertinopicker#use_magnifier "Direct link to use_magnifier")

Whether to use the magnifier for the center item of the wheel.

## Events[​](/docs/controls/cupertinopicker#events "Direct link to Events")

### `on_change`[​](/docs/controls/cupertinopicker#on_change "Direct link to on_change")

```

### Line chart[​](/docs/controls/matplotlibchart#line-chart "Direct link to Line chart")

The following example is based on [original example from Matplotlib docs](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/cohere.html#sphx-glr-gallery-lines-bars-and-markers-cohere-py).

![](https://flet.dev/docs/controls/matplotlibchart/img/docs/controls/charts/matplotlib-linechart.png)

```

## Properties[​](/docs/controls/matplotlibchart#properties "Direct link to Properties")

### `figure`[​](/docs/controls/matplotlibchart#figure "Direct link to figure")

Matplotlib figure to draw - an instance of `matplotlib.figure.Figure` class.

### `isolated`[​](/docs/controls/matplotlibchart#isolated "Direct link to isolated")

Every time when a page or parent chart control are updated with `page.update()` or `Control.update()` methods respectively the chart is re-drawn by calling Matplotlib API. Frequent re-drawings of large charts could affect the performance of the entire Flet app.

Set `isolated` to `True` to enable explicit chart updates. To re-draw the chart call its `update()` method. For example the first example on this page could be modified as following:

```

## Properties[​](/docs/controls/plotlychart#properties "Direct link to Properties")

### `figure`[​](/docs/controls/plotlychart#figure "Direct link to figure")

Plotly figure to draw - an instance of `plotly.graph_objects.Figure` class.

### `original_size`[​](/docs/controls/plotlychart#original_size "Direct link to original_size")

`True` to display chart in original size. `False` (default) to display a chart that fits configured bounds.

### `isolated`[​](/docs/controls/plotlychart#isolated "Direct link to isolated")

Every time when a page or parent chart control are updated with `page.update()` or `Control.update()` methods respectively the chart is re-drawn by calling Plotly API. Frequent re-drawings of large charts could affect the performance of the entire Flet app.

Set `isolated` to `True` to enable explicit chart updates. To re-draw the chart call its `update()` method.

# AudioRecorder

Audio recorder from microphone to a given file path. Works on macOS, Linux, Windows, iOS, Android and web. Based on the [record](https://pub.dev/packages/record) Dart/Flutter package.

note

On Linux, encoding is provided by [fmedia](https://stsaz.github.io/fmedia/) which must be installed separately.

AudioRecorder control is non-visual and should be added to `page.overlay` list.

Packaging

To build your Flet app that uses `AudioRecorder` control add `--include-packages flet_audio_recorder` to `flet build` command, for example:

```
flet build apk --include-packages flet_audio_recorder
```

# Draggable

A control that can be dragged from to a [DragTarget](/docs/controls/dragtarget).

When a draggable control recognizes the start of a drag gesture, it displays a [`content_feedback`](/docs/controls/draggable#content_feedback) control that tracks the user's finger across the screen. If the user lifts their finger while on top of a [DragTarget](/docs/controls/dragtarget), that target is given the opportunity to complete drag-and-drop flow.

This control displays [`content`](/docs/controls/draggable#content) when zero drags are under way. If [`content_when_dragging`](/docs/controls/draggable#content_when_dragging) is not `None`, this control instead displays `content_when_dragging` when one or more drags are underway. Otherwise, this widget always displays `content`.

## Properties[​](/docs/controls/draggable#properties "Direct link to Properties")

### `axis`[​](/docs/controls/draggable#axis "Direct link to axis")

The axis to restrict this draggable's movement.

When axis is set to `Axis.HORIZONTAL`, this control can only be dragged horizontally. When axis is set to `Axis.VERTICAL`, this control can only be dragged vertically.

Value is of type [`Axis`](/docs/reference/types/axis) and defaults to `None` - no restriction.

### `affinity`[​](/docs/controls/draggable#affinity "Direct link to affinity")

Controls how this control competes with other gestures to initiate a drag. If set to `None`, this widget initiates a drag as soon as it recognizes a tap down gesture, regardless of any directionality. If set to `Axis.HORIZONTAL` or `Axis.VERTICAL`, then this control will compete with other horizontal (or vertical, respectively) gestures.

Value is of type [`Axis`](/docs/reference/types/axis).

### `content`[​](/docs/controls/draggable#content "Direct link to content")

`Draggable` control displays [`content`](/docs/controls/draggable#content) when zero drags are under way. If [`content_when_dragging`](/docs/controls/draggable#content_when_dragging) is not `None`, this control instead displays `content_when_dragging` when one or more drags are underway. Otherwise, this control always displays `content`.

### `content_feedback`[​](/docs/controls/draggable#content_feedback "Direct link to content_feedback")

The `Control` to show under the pointer when a drag is under way.

### `content_when_dragging`[​](/docs/controls/draggable#content_when_dragging "Direct link to content_when_dragging")

The `Control` to display instead of `content` when one or more drags are under way.

If this is `None`, then this widget will always display `content` (and so the drag source representation will not change while a drag is under way).

### `group`[​](/docs/controls/draggable#group "Direct link to group")

A group this draggable belongs to. For [`DragTarget`](/docs/controls/dragtarget) to accept incoming drag both `Draggable` and `DragTarget` must be in the same `group`.

### `max_simultaneous_drags`[​](/docs/controls/draggable#max_simultaneous_drags "Direct link to max_simultaneous_drags")

The number of simultaneous drags to support.

-   Set this to `0` if you want to prevent the draggable from actually being dragged.
-   Set this to `1` if you want to only allow the drag source to have one item dragged at a time. In this case, consider supplying an "empty" widget for `content_when_dragging` to create the illusion of actually moving `content`.

Defaults to `None` - no limit.

## `Events`[​](/docs/controls/draggable#events "Direct link to events")

### `on_drag_complete`[​](/docs/controls/draggable#on_drag_complete "Direct link to on_drag_complete")

Fires when this draggable is dropped and accepted by a DragTarget.

### `on_drag_start`[​](/docs/controls/draggable#on_drag_start "Direct link to on_drag_start")

Fires when this draggable starts being dragged.

# DragTarget

A control that completes drag operation when a [`Draggable`](/docs/controls/draggable) widget is dropped.

When a draggable is dragged on top of a drag target, the drag target is asked whether it will accept the data the draggable is carrying. The drag target will accept incoming drag if it belongs to the same `group` as draggable. If the user does drop the draggable on top of the drag target (and the drag target has indicated that it will accept the draggable's data), then the drag target is asked to accept the draggable's data.

## Properties[​](/docs/controls/dragtarget#properties "Direct link to Properties")

### `content`[​](/docs/controls/dragtarget#content "Direct link to content")

The `Control` that is a visual representation of the drag target.

### `group`[​](/docs/controls/dragtarget#group "Direct link to group")

The group this target belongs to. Note that for this target to accept an incoming drop from a [`Draggable`](/docs/controls/draggable), they must both be in thesame group.

## Events[​](/docs/controls/dragtarget#events "Direct link to Events")

### `on_accept`[​](/docs/controls/dragtarget#on_accept "Direct link to on_accept")

Fires when the user does drop an acceptable(same `group`) draggable on this target.

Event handler argument is an instance of [`DragTargetEvent`](/docs/reference/types/dragtargetevent).

Use `page.get_control(e.src_id)` to retrieve Control reference by its ID.

### `on_leave`[​](/docs/controls/dragtarget#on_leave "Direct link to on_leave")

Fires when a draggable leaves this target.

### `on_move`[​](/docs/controls/dragtarget#on_move "Direct link to on_move")

Fires when a draggable moves within this target.

Event handler argument is of type [`DragTargetEvent`](/docs/reference/types/dragtargetevent).

### `on_will_accept`[​](/docs/controls/dragtarget#on_will_accept "Direct link to on_will_accept")

Fires when a draggable is dragged on this target. `data` field of event details contains `true` (String) if both the draggable and this target are in the same `group`; otherwise `false` (String).

# FilePicker

A control that allows you to use the native file explorer to pick single or multiple files, with extensions filtering support and upload.

info

In Linux, the FilePicker control depends on [Zenity](https://help.gnome.org/users/zenity/stable/) when running Flet as an app. This is not a requirement when running Flet in a browser.

To install Zenity on Ubuntu/Debian run the following commands:

```
sudo apt-get install zenity
```

## Properties[​](/docs/controls/filepicker#properties "Direct link to Properties")

### `allowed_extensions`[​](/docs/controls/filepicker#allowed_extensions "Direct link to allowed_extensions")

Allow picking files with specified extensions only.

The value of this property is a list of strings, e.g. `["pdf", "svg", "jpg"]`.

### `allow_multiple`[​](/docs/controls/filepicker#allow_multiple "Direct link to allow_multiple")

Allow selecting multiple files.

### `dialog_title`[​](/docs/controls/filepicker#dialog_title "Direct link to dialog_title")

Can be optionally set on desktop platforms to set the modal window title. It will be ignored on other platforms.

### `file_name`[​](/docs/controls/filepicker#file_name "Direct link to file_name")

Works for "Save file" dialog only. Can be set to a non-empty string to provide a default file name.

### `file_type`[​](/docs/controls/filepicker#file_type "Direct link to file_type")

Allow to pick files of specific group.

Value is of type [`FilePickerFileType`](/docs/reference/types/filepickerfiletype) and defaults to `FilePickerFileType.ANY`.

### `initial_directory`[​](/docs/controls/filepicker#initial_directory "Direct link to initial_directory")

Can be optionally set to an absolute path to specify where the dialog should open. Only supported on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

### `result`[​](/docs/controls/filepicker#result "Direct link to result")

Result is set when the dialog is closed.

Value is of type [`FilePickerResultEvent`](/docs/reference/types/filepickerresultevent).

## Methods[​](/docs/controls/filepicker#methods "Direct link to Methods")

### `get_directory_path()`[​](/docs/controls/filepicker#get_directory_path "Direct link to get_directory_path")

Selects a directory and returns its absolute path.

You could either set the following file picker properties or provide their values in the method call:

-   `dialog_title` - the title of the dialog window.
-   `initial_directory` - the initial directory where the dialog should open.

### `pick_files()`[​](/docs/controls/filepicker#pick_files "Direct link to pick_files")

Retrieves the file(s) from the underlying platform.

You could either set the following file picker properties or provide their values in the method call:

-   `dialog_title` - the title of the dialog window.
-   `initial_directory` - the initial directory where the dialog should open.
-   `file_type` - the allowed [`FilePickerFileType`](/docs/reference/types/filepickerfiletype).
-   `allowed_extensions` - the allowed file extensions. Has effect only if `file_type` is `FilePickerFileType.CUSTOM`.
-   `allow_multiple` - allow selecting multiple files.

### `save_file()`[​](/docs/controls/filepicker#save_file "Direct link to save_file")

Opens a save file dialog which lets the user select a file path and a file name to save a file.

This function does not actually save a file. It only opens the dialog to let the user choose a location and file name. This function only returns the path to this (non-existing) file in `FilePicker.result.path` property.

This method is only available on desktop platforms (Linux, macOS & Windows).

You could either set the following file picker properties or provide their values in the method call:

-   `dialog_title` - the title of the dialog window.
-   `file_name` - the default file name.
-   `initial_directory` - the initial directory where the dialog should open.
-   `file_type` - the allowed [`FilePickerFileType`](/docs/reference/types/filepickerfiletype).
-   `allowed_extensions` - the allowed file extensions. Has effect only if `file_type` is `FilePickerFileType.CUSTOM`.

info

To save a file from the web, you don't need to use the FilePicker object.

You can instead provides an API endpoint `/download/:filename` that returns the file content, and then use [`page.launch_url`](/docs/controls/page#launch_urlurl) to open the url, which will trigger the browser's save file dialog.

Take [FastAPI](/docs/publish/web/dynamic-website#advanced-fastapi-scenarios) as an example, you can use the following code to implement the endpoint:

```
from fastapi import FastAPI, Responsefrom fastapi.responses import FileResponseapp = flet_fastapi.app(main)@app.get("/download/{filename}")def download(filename: str):    path = prepare_file(filename)    return FileResponse(path)
```

and then use `page.launch_url("/download/myfile.txt")` to open the url, for instance, when a button is clicked.

```
ft.ElevatedButton("Download myfile", on_click=lambda _: page.launch_url("/download/myfile.txt"))
```

### `upload()`[​](/docs/controls/filepicker#upload "Direct link to upload")

Uploads selected files to specified upload URLs.

Before calling upload [`pick_files()`](/docs/controls/filepicker#pick_files) must be called, so the internal file picker selection is not empty.

Method arguments:

-   `files` - a list of [`FilePickerUploadFile`](/docs/reference/types/filepickeruploadfile).

Each list item specifies which file should be uploaded to the upload URL with `PUT` (default) or `POST` method.

-   `name`
-   `upload_url`
-   `method` (`PUT` (default), `POST`)

`upload_url` is, generally, a pre-signed URL ( like [AWS S3 object upload URL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/PresignedUrlUploadObject.html)).

For built-in upload storage a signed upload URL can be generated with the following call:

```
upload_url = page.get_upload_url("dir/filename.ext", 60)
```

First argument is a relative to upload storage path. Second argument is a URL time-to-live in seconds.

To enable built-in upload storage provide `upload_dir` argument to `flet.app()` call:

```
ft.app(main, upload_dir="uploads")
```

## Events[​](/docs/controls/filepicker#events "Direct link to Events")

### `on_result`[​](/docs/controls/filepicker#on_result "Direct link to on_result")

Fires when file picker dialog is closed.

Event object is an instance of [`FilePickerResultEvent`](/docs/reference/types/filepickerresultevent). See [`FilePicker.result`](/docs/controls/filepicker#result) for class properties.

### `on_upload`[​](/docs/controls/filepicker#on_upload "Direct link to on_upload")

Fires when a file upload progress is updated.

Event object is an instance of [`FilePickerUploadEvent`](/docs/reference/types/filepickeruploadevent).

# Geolocator

Geolocator fetches Position from device GPS. Works on macOS, Windows, iOS, Android and web. Based on the [geolocator](https://pub.dev/packages/geolocator) Dart/Flutter package.

Geolocator control is non-visual and should be added to `page.overlay` list.

Packaging

To build your Flet app that uses `Geolocator` control add `--include-packages flet_geolocator` to `flet build` command, for example:

```
flet build apk --include-packages flet_geolocator
```

## Properties[​](/docs/controls/geolocator#properties "Direct link to Properties")

### `location_settings`[​](/docs/controls/geolocator#location_settings "Direct link to location_settings")

Value is of type [`GeolocatorSettings`](/docs/reference/types/geolocatorsettings).

## Methods[​](/docs/controls/geolocator#methods "Direct link to Methods")

### `get_current_position(accuracy, location_settings)`[​](/docs/controls/geolocator#get_current_positionaccuracy-location_settings "Direct link to get_current_positionaccuracy-location_settings")

Gets the current position of the device with the desired accuracy and settings.

This method has the following properties:

-   `accuracy`: value is of type [`GeolocatorPositionAccuracy`](/docs/reference/types/geolocatorpositionaccuracy) and defaults to `GeolocatorPositionAccuracy.BEST`.

# GestureDetector

A control that detects gestures.

Attempts to recognize gestures that correspond to its non-null callbacks.

If this control has a `content`, it defers to that child control for its sizing behavior. If it does not have a `content`, it grows to fit the parent instead.

## Examples[​](/docs/controls/gesturedetector#examples "Direct link to Examples")

[Live example](https://flet-controls-gallery.fly.dev/utility/gesturedetector)

[Solitare game tutorial](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire)

### Draggable containers[​](/docs/controls/gesturedetector#draggable-containers "Direct link to Draggable containers")

The following example demonstrates how a control can be freely dragged inside a Stack.

The sample also shows that GestureDetector can have a child control (blue container) as well as be nested inside another control (yellow container) giving the same results.

-   Python

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    def on_pan_update1(e: ft.DragUpdateEvent):        c.top = max(0, c.top + e.delta_y)        c.left = max(0, c.left + e.delta_x)        c.update()    def on_pan_update2(e: ft.DragUpdateEvent):        e.control.top = max(0, e.control.top + e.delta_y)        e.control.left = max(0, e.control.left + e.delta_x)        e.control.update()    gd = ft.GestureDetector(        mouse_cursor=ft.MouseCursor.MOVE,        drag_interval=50,        on_pan_update=on_pan_update1,    )    c = ft.Container(gd, bgcolor=ft.Colors.AMBER, width=50, height=50, left=0, top=0)    gd1 = ft.GestureDetector(        mouse_cursor=ft.MouseCursor.MOVE,        drag_interval=10,        on_vertical_drag_update=on_pan_update2,        left=100,        top=100,        content=ft.Container(bgcolor=ft.Colors.BLUE, width=50, height=50),    )    page.add( ft.Stack([c, gd1], width=1000, height=500))ft.app(main)
```

## Properties[​](/docs/controls/gesturedetector#properties "Direct link to Properties")

### `content`[​](/docs/controls/gesturedetector#content "Direct link to content")

A child Control contained by the gesture detector.

### `mouse_cursor`[​](/docs/controls/gesturedetector#mouse_cursor "Direct link to mouse_cursor")

The mouse cursor for mouse pointers that are hovering over the control.

Value is of type [`MouseCursor`](/docs/reference/types/mousecursor).

### `drag_interval`[​](/docs/controls/gesturedetector#drag_interval "Direct link to drag_interval")

Throttling in milliseconds for horizontal drag, vertical drag and pan update events. When a user moves a pointer a lot of events are being generated to do precise tracking. `drag_interval` allows sending drag update events to a Flet program every X milliseconds, thus preserving the bandwidth (web and mobile apps). Default is `0` - no throttling, all events are sent to a Flet program, very smooth tracking.

### `hover_interval`[​](/docs/controls/gesturedetector#hover_interval "Direct link to hover_interval")

Throttling in milliseconds for `on_hover` event.

## Events[​](/docs/controls/gesturedetector#events "Direct link to Events")

### `multi_tap_touches`[​](/docs/controls/gesturedetector#multi_tap_touches "Direct link to multi_tap_touches")

The minimum number of pointers to trigger `on_multi_tap` event.

### `on_double_tap`[​](/docs/controls/gesturedetector#on_double_tap "Direct link to on_double_tap")

The user has tapped the screen with a primary button at the same location twice in quick succession.

### `on_double_tap_down`[​](/docs/controls/gesturedetector#on_double_tap_down "Direct link to on_double_tap_down")

A pointer that might cause a double tap has contacted the screen at a particular location.

Triggered immediately after the down event of the second tap.

Event handler argument is of type [`MapTapEvent`](/docs/reference/types/tapevent).

### `on_enter`[​](/docs/controls/gesturedetector#on_enter "Direct link to on_enter")

Triggered when a mouse pointer has entered this control.

Event handler argument is of type [`HoverEvent`](/docs/reference/types/hoverevent).

### `on_exit`[​](/docs/controls/gesturedetector#on_exit "Direct link to on_exit")

Triggered when a mouse pointer has exited this control.

Event handler argument is of type [`HoverEvent`](/docs/reference/types/hoverevent).

### `on_horizontal_drag_end`[​](/docs/controls/gesturedetector#on_horizontal_drag_end "Direct link to on_horizontal_drag_end")

A pointer that was previously in contact with the screen with a primary button and moving horizontally is no longer in contact with the screen and was moving at a specific velocity when it stopped contacting the screen.

Event handler argument is of type [`DragEndEvent`](/docs/reference/types/dragendevent).

### `on_horizontal_drag_start`[​](/docs/controls/gesturedetector#on_horizontal_drag_start "Direct link to on_horizontal_drag_start")

On this page

# PermissionHandler

PermissionHandler can check and/or request permissions from the running device for access to various components. Works on Windows, iOS, Android and web. Based on the [permission\_handler](https://pub.dev/packages/permission_handler) Dart/Flutter package.

PermissionHandler control is non-visual and should be added to [`page.overlay`](/docs/controls/page#overlay) list.

Packaging

To build your Flet app that uses `PermissionHandler` control, add `--include-packages flet_permission_handler` to `flet build` command, for example:

```
flet build apk --include-packages flet_permission_handler
```

## Examples[​](/docs/controls/permissionhandler#examples "Direct link to Examples")

### Basic Example[​](/docs/controls/permissionhandler#basic-example "Direct link to Basic Example")

-   Python

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    page.scroll = ft.ScrollMode.ADAPTIVE    page.appbar = ft.AppBar(title=ft.Text("PermissionHandler Tests"))    ph = ft.PermissionHandler()    page.overlay.append(ph)    def check_permission(e):        o = ph.check_permission(e.control.data)        page.add(ft.Text(f"Checked {e.control.data.name}: {o}"))    def request_permission(e):        o = ph.request_permission(e.control.data)        page.add(ft.Text(f"Requested {e.control.data.name}: {o}"))    def open_app_settings(e):        o = ph.open_app_settings()        page.add(ft.Text(f"App Settings: {o}"))    page.add(        ft.OutlinedButton(            "Check Microphone Permission",            data=ft.PermissionType.MICROPHONE,            on_click=check_permission,        ),        ft.OutlinedButton(            "Request Microphone Permission",            data=ft.PermissionType.MICROPHONE,            on_click=request_permission,        ),        ft.OutlinedButton(            "Open App Settings",            on_click=open_app_settings,        ),    )ft.app(main)
```

## Methods[​](/docs/controls/permissionhandler#methods "Direct link to Methods")

### `check_permission(of: PermissionType)`[​](/docs/controls/permissionhandler#check_permissionof-permissiontype "Direct link to check_permissionof-permissiontype")

Checks the status of the specified [`PermissionType`](/docs/reference/types/permissiontype).

Returns an instance of type [`PermissionStatus`](/docs/reference/types/permissionstatus).

### `open_app_settings()`[​](/docs/controls/permissionhandler#open_app_settings "Direct link to open_app_settings")

Opens the device's settings. Before calling this method, you usually want to briefly remind the user of which permission is needed and how/where precisely it is to be enabled.

Returns a boolean value: `True` if the device's settings were opened successfully, `False` otherwise.

### `request_permission(of: PermissionType)`[​](/docs/controls/permissionhandler#request_permissionof-permissiontype "Direct link to request_permissionof-permissiontype")

Requests the device for access to the specified [`PermissionType`](/docs/reference/types/permissiontype) from the user.

Returns an instance of type [`PermissionStatus`](/docs/reference/types/permissionstatus).

# SelectionArea

Flet controls are not selectable by default. `SelectionArea` is used to enable selection for its `content`.

## Examples[​](/docs/controls/selectionarea#examples "Direct link to Examples")

### Selectable Text controls[​](/docs/controls/selectionarea#selectable-text-controls "Direct link to Selectable Text controls")

-   Python

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    page.add(        ft.SelectionArea(            content=ft.Column([ft.Text("Selectable text"), ft.Text("Also selectable")])        )    )    page.add(ft.Text("Not selectable"))ft.app(main)
```

## Properties[​](/docs/controls/selectionarea#properties "Direct link to Properties")

### `content`[​](/docs/controls/selectionarea#content "Direct link to content")

A child Control contained by the SelectionArea. If you need to have multiple selectable controls, use `Row`, `Column`, or `Stack`, which have a `controls` property, and then provide multiple controls to that control.

## Events[​](/docs/controls/selectionarea#events "Direct link to Events")

### `on_change`[​](/docs/controls/selectionarea#on_change "Direct link to on_change")

Fires when the selected content changes.

# SemanticsService

Allows access to the platform's accessibility services.

## Methods[​](/docs/controls/semanticsservice#methods "Direct link to Methods")

### `announce_message(message, rtl, assertiveness)`[​](/docs/controls/semanticsservice#announce_messagemessage-rtl-assertiveness "Direct link to announce_messagemessage-rtl-assertiveness")

Sends a semantic announcement with the given `message`. This should preferably be used for announcement that are not seamlessly announced by the system as a result of a UI state change.

`rtl` is a boolean and indicates the text direction of the `message`.

The `assertiveness` level of the announcement is only supported by the web engine and has no effect on other platforms. Value is an `Assertiveness` enum and can either be `Assertiveness.ASSERTIVE` or `Assertiveness.POLITE` (default).

Defaults to `False`.

### `announce_tooltip(message)`[​](/docs/controls/semanticsservice#announce_tooltipmessage "Direct link to announce_tooltipmessage")

Sends a semantic announcement of a tooltip. Currently honored on Android only. The provided `message` will be read by TalkBack.

# ShaderMask

A control that applies a mask generated by a shader to its child.

For example, `ShaderMask` can be used to gradually fade out the edge of a child by using a [`LinearGradient`](/docs/reference/types/lineargradient) mask.

# TransparentPointer

TransparentPointer is the solution to ["How to pass through all gestures between two widgets in Stack"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65269190/pass-trough-all-gestures-between-two-widgets-in-stack) problem.

For example, if there is an [`ElevatedButton`](/docs/controls/elevatedbutton) inside [`Container`](/docs/controls/container) with [`GestureDetector`](/docs/controls/gesturedetector) then tapping on a button won't be "visible" to a gesture detector behind it. With `TransparentPointer` a tapping event doesn't stop on a button, but goes up to the parent, similar to event bubbling in HTML/JS.

## Example[​](/docs/controls/transparentpointer#example "Direct link to Example")

```
import flet as ftdef main(page):    page.add(        ft.Stack(            [                ft.GestureDetector(                    on_tap=lambda _: print("TAP!"),                    multi_tap_touches=3,                    on_multi_tap=lambda e: print(                        "MULTI TAP:", e.correct_touches                    ),                    on_multi_long_press=lambda _: print("Multi tap long press"),                ),                ft.TransparentPointer(ft.Container(                    ft.ElevatedButton("Test button"),                    padding=50                )),            ],            expand=True,        )    )ft.app(main)
```

## Properties[​](/docs/controls/transparentpointer#properties "Direct link to Properties")

### `content`[​](/docs/controls/transparentpointer#content "Direct link to content")

The `Control` that should be displayed inside the TransparentPointer.

# Theming

It is possible to configure your application and/or the containing controls to follow a particular themes.

### App-wide themes[​](/docs/cookbook/theming#app-wide-themes "Direct link to App-wide themes")

The `Page` control (uppermost control in the tree) has two useful properties for this: `theme` and `dark_theme` properties to configure the appearance/theme of the entire app in light and dark theme modes respectively.

Both of type [`Theme`](/docs/reference/types/theme), they represent the default/fallback themes to be used app-wide, except explicitly modified/overriden in the tree.

```
page.theme = ft.Theme(color_scheme_seed=ft.Colors.GREEN)page.dark_theme = ft.Theme(color_scheme_seed=ft.Colors.BLUE)
```

### Nested themes[​](/docs/cookbook/theming#nested-themes "Direct link to Nested themes")

You can have a part of your app to use a different theme or override some theme styles for specific controls.

Some container-like controls have `theme` and `theme_mode` properties of type [`Theme`](/docs/reference/types/theme) and [`ThemeMode`](/docs/reference/types/thememode) respectively.

Specifying `theme_mode` in the `Container` means you don't want to inherit parent theme mode, but want a completely new, unique scheme for all controls inside the container. However, if the container does not have `theme_mode` property set then the styles from its theme property will override the ones from the parent inherited theme:

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    # Yellow page theme with SYSTEM (default) mode    page.theme = ft.Theme(        color_scheme_seed=ft.Colors.YELLOW,    )    page.add(        # Page theme        ft.Container(            content=ft.ElevatedButton("Page theme button"),            bgcolor=ft.Colors.SURFACE_VARIANT,            padding=20,            width=300,        ),        # Inherited theme with primary color overridden        ft.Container(            theme=ft.Theme(color_scheme=ft.ColorScheme(primary=ft.Colors.PINK)),            content=ft.ElevatedButton("Inherited theme button"),            bgcolor=ft.Colors.SURFACE_VARIANT,            padding=20,            width=300,        ),        # Unique always DARK theme        ft.Container(            theme=ft.Theme(color_scheme_seed=ft.Colors.INDIGO),            theme_mode=ft.ThemeMode.DARK,            content=ft.ElevatedButton("Unique theme button"),            bgcolor=ft.Colors.SURFACE_VARIANT,            padding=20,            width=300,        ),    )ft.app(main)
```

# Keyboard shortcuts

A solid keyboard support is a key for user productivity while using your web and, especially, desktop app. Indeed, it could be really annoying to constantly switch between mouse and keyboard.

In addition to form controls' `.autofocus` property and [`TextField.focus()`](/docs/controls/textfield#focus) method Flet allows handling "global" keyboard events.

To capture all keystrokes implement `page.on_keyboard_event` handler. Event handler parameter `e` is an instance of `KeyboardEvent` class with the following properties:

-   `key` - a textual representation of a pressed key, e.g. `A`, `Enter` or `F5`.
-   `shift` - `True` if "Shift" key is pressed.
-   `ctrl` - `True` if "Control" key is pressed.
-   `alt` - `True` if "Alt" ("Option") key is pressed.
-   `meta` - `True` if "Command" key is pressed.

This is a simple usage example:

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    def on_keyboard(e: ft.KeyboardEvent):        page.add(            ft.Text(                f"Key: {e.key}, Shift: {e.shift}, Control: {e.ctrl}, Alt: {e.alt}, Meta: {e.meta}"            )        )    page.on_keyboard_event = on_keyboard    page.add(        ft.Text("Press any key with a combination of CTRL, ALT, SHIFT and META keys...")    )ft.app(main)
```

# Large lists

You can use [`Column`](/docs/controls/column) and [`Row`](/docs/controls/row) controls to display lists in the most cases, but if the list contains hundreds or thousands of items `Column` and `Row` will be ineffective with lagging UI as they render all items at once even they are not visible at the current scrolling position.

In the following example we are adding 5,000 text controls to a page. Page uses `Column` as a default layout container:

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    for i in range(5000):        page.controls.append(ft.Text(f"Line {i}"))    page.scroll = "always"    page.update()ft.app(main, view=ft.AppView.WEB_BROWSER)
```

Run the program and notice that it's not just it takes a couple of seconds to initially load and render all text lines on a page, but scrolling is slow and laggy too:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/cookbook/large-lists/img/docs/getting-started/scroll-column.gif)

For displaying lists with a lot of items use [`ListView`](/docs/controls/listview) and [`GridView`](/docs/controls/gridview) controls which render items on demand, visible at the current scrolling position only.

## ListView[​](/docs/cookbook/large-lists#listview "Direct link to ListView")

[`ListView`](/docs/controls/listview) could be either vertical (default) or horizontal. ListView items are displayed one after another in the scroll direction.

ListView already implements effective on demand rendering of its children, but scrolling performance could be further improved if you can set the same fixed height or width (for `horizontal` ListView) for all items ("extent"). This could be done by either setting absolute extent with `item_extent` property or making the extent of all children equal to the extent of the first child by setting `first_item_prototype` to `True`.

Let's output a list of 5,000 items using ListView control:

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    lv = ft.ListView(expand=True, spacing=10)    for i in range(5000):        lv.controls.append(ft.Text(f"Line {i}"))    page.add(lv)ft.app(main, view=ft.AppView.WEB_BROWSER)
```

Now the scrolling is smooth and fast enough to follow mouse movements:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/cookbook/large-lists/img/docs/getting-started/scroll-listview.gif)

note

We used `expand=True` in ListView constructor. In order to function properly, ListView must have a height (or width if `horizontal`) specified. You could set an absolute size, e.g. `ListView(height=300, spacing=10)`, but in the example above we make ListView to take all available space on the page, i.e. expand. Read more about [`Control.expand`](/docs/controls#expand) property.

## GridView[​](/docs/cookbook/large-lists#gridview "Direct link to GridView")

[`GridView`](/docs/controls/gridview) allows arranging controls into a scrollable grid.

You can make a "grid" with `ft.Column(wrap=True)` or `ft.Row(wrap=True)`, for example:

```
import osimport flet as ftos.environ["FLET_WS_MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE"] = "8000000"def main(page: ft.Page):    r = ft.Row(wrap=True, scroll="always", expand=True)    page.add(r)    for i in range(5000):        r.controls.append(            ft.Container(                ft.Text(f"Item {i}"),                width=100,                height=100,                alignment=ft.alignment.center,                bgcolor=ft.Colors.AMBER_100,                border=ft.border.all(1, ft.Colors.AMBER_400),                border_radius=ft.border_radius.all(5),            )        )    page.update()ft.app(main, view=ft.AppView.WEB_BROWSER)
```

![](https://flet.dev/docs/cookbook/large-lists/img/docs/getting-started/row-wrap-as-grid.png)

Try scrolling and resizing the browser window - everything works, but very laggy.

note

At the start of the program we are setting the value of `FLET_WS_MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE` environment variable to `8000000` - this is the maximum size of WebSocket message in bytes that can be received by Flet Server rendering the page. Default size is 1 MB, but the size of JSON message describing 5,000 container controls would exceed 1 MB, so we are increasing allowed size to 8 MB.

Squeezing large messages through WebSocket channel is, generally, not a good idea, so use [batched updates](/docs/cookbook/large-lists#batch-updates) approach to control channel load.

GridView, similar to ListView, is very effective to render a lot of children. Let's implement the example above using GridView:

```
import osimport flet as ftos.environ["FLET_WS_MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE"] = "8000000"def main(page: ft.Page):    gv = ft.GridView(expand=True, max_extent=150, child_aspect_ratio=1)    page.add(gv)    for i in range(5000):        gv.controls.append(            ft.Container(                ft.Text(f"Item {i}"),                alignment=ft.alignment.center,                bgcolor=ft.Colors.AMBER_100,                border=ft.border.all(1, ft.Colors.AMBER_400),                border_radius=ft.border_radius.all(5),            )        )    page.update()ft.app(main, view=ft.AppView.WEB_BROWSER)
```

![](https://flet.dev/docs/cookbook/large-lists/img/docs/getting-started/grid-view.png)

With GridView scrolling and window resizing are smooth and responsive!

You can specify either fixed number of rows or columns (runs) with `runs_count` property or the maximum size of a "tile" with `max_extent` property, so the number of runs can vary automatically. In our example we set the maximum tile size to 150 pixels and set its shape to "square" with `child_aspect_ratio=1`. `child_aspect_ratio` is the ratio of the cross-axis to the main-axis extent of each child. Try changing it to `0.5` or `2`.

## Batch updates[​](/docs/cookbook/large-lists#batch-updates "Direct link to Batch updates")

When `page.update()` is called a message is being sent to Flet server over WebSockets containing page updates since the last `page.update()`. Sending a large message with thousands of added controls could make a user waiting for a few seconds until the messages is fully received and controls rendered.

To increase usability of your program and present the results to a user as soon as possible you can send page updates in batches. For example, the following program adds 5,100 child controls to a ListView in batches of 500 items:

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    # add ListView to a page first    lv = ft.ListView(expand=1, spacing=10, item_extent=50)    page.add(lv)    for i in range(5100):        lv.controls.append(ft.Text(f"Line {i}"))        # send page to a page        if i % 500 == 0:            page.update()    # send the rest to a page    page.update()ft.app(main, view=ft.AppView.WEB_BROWSER)
```

# Drag and drop

The mechanics of drag-and-drop in Flet is pretty simple - a user starts dragging [`Draggable`](/docs/controls/draggable) control and "drops" it on [`DragTarget`](/docs/controls/dragtarget). If both draggable and drag target has the same `group` a drag target will call `on_accept` event handler and pass draggable control ID as event data. In this case draggable serves as a source "data" for drag-and-drop operation.

Let's take a look at the following example. In the program below you can drag left control displaying "1" on top of the right control displaying "0" and when drag operation completes left control is replaced with "0" and the right control becomes "1":

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    page.title = "Drag and Drop example"    def drag_accept(e):        # get draggable (source) control by its ID        src = page.get_control(e.src_id)        # update text inside draggable control        src.content.content.value = "0"        # update text inside drag target control        e.control.content.content.value = "1"        page.update()    page.add(        ft.Row(            [                ft.Draggable(                    group="number",                    content=ft.Container(                        width=50,                        height=50,                        bgcolor=ft.Colors.CYAN_200,                        border_radius=5,                        content=ft.Text("1", size=20),                        alignment=ft.alignment.center,                    ),                ),                ft.Container(width=100),                ft.DragTarget(                    group="number",                    content=ft.Container(                        width=50,                        height=50,                        bgcolor=ft.Colors.PINK_200,                        border_radius=5,                        content=ft.Text("0", size=20),                        alignment=ft.alignment.center,                    ),                    on_accept=drag_accept,                ),            ]        )    )ft.app(main)
```

![](https://flet.dev/docs/cookbook/drag-and-drop/img/docs/getting-started/drag-and-drop-number.gif)

So, it's developer's responsibility to determine what happens with "source" (draggable) and "destination" (drag target) controls when `on_accept` event occurs.

Try something

Change DragTarget's group property to `number1` and note `on_accept` is not called any more when you drop "1" on the target.

There are additional properties and event handlers to make drag-and-drop operation even more interactive. For example, draggable has `content_when_dragging` property to display a different control instead of `content` when drag operation is under way. There is also `content_feedback` property to show a different control under the pointer. By default, the same `content` control, but with 50% opacity is displayed under cursor when dragging.

Let's modify Draggable in our example to display a "hole" in place of dragged control and just "1" under cursor while dragging:

```
...                ft.Draggable(                    group="number",                    content=ft.Container(                        width=50,                        height=50,                        bgcolor=ft.Colors.CYAN_200,                        border_radius=5,                        content=ft.Text("1", size=20),                        alignment=ft.alignment.center,                    ),                    content_when_dragging=ft.Container(                        width=50,                        height=50,                        bgcolor=ft.Colors.BLUE_GREY_200,                        border_radius=5,                    ),                    content_feedback=ft.Text("1"),                ),...
```

![](https://flet.dev/docs/cookbook/drag-and-drop/img/docs/getting-started/drag-and-drop-number-2.gif)

Drag target control additionally has `on_will_accept` and `on_leave` event handlers which help better visualize when it's a good time to "drop" something on the target. Let's modify DragTarget in our example to draw a border around target control when it's ready to accept incoming drag:

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    page.title = "Drag and Drop example 2"    def drag_accept(e):        # get draggable (source) control by its ID        src = page.get_control(e.src_id)        # update text inside draggable control        src.content.content.value = "0"        # reset source group, so it cannot be dropped to a target anymore        src.group = ""        # update text inside drag target control        e.control.content.content.value = "1"        # reset border        e.control.content.border = None        page.update()    def drag_will_accept(e):        # black border when it's allowed to drop and red when it's not        e.control.content.border = ft.border.all(            2, ft.Colors.BLACK45 if e.data == "true" else ft.Colors.RED        )        e.control.update()    def drag_leave(e):        e.control.content.border = None        e.control.update()    page.add(        ft.Row(            [                ft.Draggable(                    group="number",                    content=ft.Container(                        width=50,                        height=50,                        bgcolor=ft.Colors.CYAN_200,                        border_radius=5,                        content=ft.Text("1", size=20),                        alignment=ft.alignment.center,                    ),                    content_when_dragging=ft.Container(                        width=50,                        height=50,                        bgcolor=ft.Colors.BLUE_GREY_200,                        border_radius=5,                    ),                    content_feedback=ft.Text("1"),                ),                ft.Container(width=100),                ft.DragTarget(                    group="number",                    content=ft.Container(                        width=50,                        height=50,                        bgcolor=ft.Colors.PINK_200,                        border_radius=5,                        content=ft.Text("0", size=20),                        alignment=ft.alignment.center,                    ),                    on_accept=drag_accept,                    on_will_accept=drag_will_accept,                    on_leave=drag_leave,                ),            ]        )    )ft.app(main)
```

# File picker and uploads

[File picker](/docs/controls/filepicker) control opens a native OS dialog for selecting files and directories.

It works on all platforms: Web, macOS, Window, Linux, iOS and Android.

![](https://flet.dev/docs/cookbook/file-picker-and-uploads/img/docs/controls/file-picker/file-picker-all-modes-demo.png)

Check out [source code of the demo above](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/main/python/controls/file-picker/file-picker-all-modes.py).

File picker allows opening three dialogs:

-   **Pick files** - one or multiple, any files or only specific types.
-   **Save file** - choose directory and file name.
-   **Get directory** - select directory.

When running Flet app in a browser only "Pick files" option is available and it's used for uploads only as it, obviously, doesn't return a full path to a selected file.

Where file picker really shines is a desktop! All three dialogs return full paths to selected files and directories - great assistance to your users!

info

In Linux, the FilePicker control depends on [Zenity](https://help.gnome.org/users/zenity/stable/) when running Flet as an app. This is not a requirement when running Flet in a browser.

To install Zenity on Ubuntu/Debian run the following commands:

```
sudo apt-get install zenity
```

## Using file picker in your app[​](/docs/cookbook/file-picker-and-uploads#using-file-picker-in-your-app "Direct link to Using file picker in your app")

It is recommended to add file picker to [`page.overlay.controls`](/docs/controls/page#overlay) collection, so it doesn't affect the layout of your app. Despite file picker has 0x0 size it is still considered as a control when put into `Row` or `Column`.

```
import flet as ftfile_picker = ft.FilePicker()page.overlay.append(file_picker)page.update()
```

To open file picker dialog call one of the three methods:

-   `pick_files()`
-   `save_file()`
-   `get_directory_path()`

Lambda works pretty nice for that:

```
ft.ElevatedButton("Choose files...",    on_click=lambda _: file_picker.pick_files(allow_multiple=True))
```

When dialog is closed `FilePicker.on_result` event handler is called which event object has one of the following properties set:

-   `files` - "Pick files" dialog only, a list of selected files or `None` if dialog was cancelled.
-   `path` - "Save file" and "Get directory" dialogs, a full path to a file or directory or `None` if dialog was cancelled.

```
import flet as ftdef on_dialog_result(e: ft.FilePickerResultEvent):    print("Selected files:", e.files)    print("Selected file or directory:", e.path)file_picker = ft.FilePicker(on_result=on_dialog_result)
```

The last result is always available in `FilePicker.result` property.

Check [File picker](/docs/controls/filepicker) control docs for all available dialog methods and their parameters.

## Uploading files[​](/docs/cookbook/file-picker-and-uploads#uploading-files "Direct link to Uploading files")

File picker has built-in upload capabilities that work on all platforms and the web.

To upload one or more files you should call `FilePicker.pick_files()` first. When the files are selected by the user they are not automatically uploaded anywhere, but instead their references are kept in the file picker state.

To perform an actual upload you should call `FilePicker.upload()` method and pass the list of files that need to be uploaded along with their upload URLs and upload method (`PUT` or `POST`):

```
import flet as ftdef upload_files(e):    upload_list = []    if file_picker.result != None and file_picker.result.files != None:        for f in file_picker.result.files:            upload_list.append(                FilePickerUploadFile(                    f.name,                    upload_url=page.get_upload_url(f.name, 600),                )            )        file_picker.upload(upload_list)ft.ElevatedButton("Upload", on_click=upload_files)
```

note

If you need to separate uploads for each user you can specify a filename prepended with any number of directories in `page.get_upload_url()` call, for example:

```
upload_url = page.get_upload_url(f"/{username}/pictures/{f.name}", 600)
```

`/{username}/pictures` directories will be automatically created inside `upload_dir` if not exist.

### Upload storage[​](/docs/cookbook/file-picker-and-uploads#upload-storage "Direct link to Upload storage")

Notice the usage of `page.get_upload_url()` method - it generates a presigned upload URL for Flet's internal upload storage.

Use any storage for file uploads

You can [generate presigned upload URL](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/s3-presigned-urls.html#generating-a-presigned-url-to-upload-a-file) for AWS S3 storage using boto3 library.

The same technique should work for [Wasabi](https://wasabi.com/), [Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/), [MinIO](https://min.io/) and any other storage providers with S3-compatible API.

To enable Flet saving uploaded files to a directory provide full or relative path to that directory in `flet.app()` call:

```
ft.app(main, upload_dir="uploads")
```

You can even put uploads inside "assets" directory, so uploaded files, e.g. pictures, docs or other media, can be accessed from a Flet client right away:

```
ft.app(main, assets_dir="assets", upload_dir="assets/uploads")
```

and somewhere in your app you can display uploaded picture with:

```
page.add(ft.Image(src="/uploads/<some-uploaded-picture.png>"))
```

### Upload progress[​](/docs/cookbook/file-picker-and-uploads#upload-progress "Direct link to Upload progress")

Once `FilePicker.upload()` method is called Flet client asynchronously starts uploading selected files one-by-one and reports the progress via `FilePicker.on_upload` callback.

Event object of `on_upload` event is an instance of `FilePickerUploadEvent` class with the following fields:

-   `file_name`
-   `progress` - a value from `0.0` to `1.0`.
-   `error`

The callback is called at least twice for every uploaded file: with `0` progress before upload begins and with `1.0` progress when upload is finished. For files larger than 1 MB a progress is additionally reported for every 10% uploaded.

Check that [example](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/main/python/controls/file-picker/file-picker-upload-progress.py) demonstrating multiple file uploads:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/cookbook/file-picker-and-uploads/img/docs/controls/file-picker/file-picker-multiple-uploads.png)

See [File picker](/docs/controls/filepicker) control docs for all its properties and examples.

# Animations

## Implicit animations[​](/docs/cookbook/animations#implicit-animations "Direct link to Implicit animations")

With implicit animations, you can animate a control property by setting a target value; whenever that target value changes, the control animates the property from the old value to the new one. Animation produces interpolated values between the old and the new value over the given *duration*. By default, the animation is *linearly* increasing the animation value, however, a *curve* can be applied to the animation which changes the value according to the provided curve. For example, `easeOutCubic` curve increases the animation value quickly at the beginning of the animation and then slows down until the target value is reached:

Each `Control` provides a number of `animate_{something}` properties, described below, to enable implicit animation of its appearance:

-   `animate_opacity`
-   `animate_rotation`
-   `animate_scale`
-   `animate_offset`
-   `animate_position`
-   `animate` (Container)

`animate_*` properties could have one of the following values:

-   Instance of `animation.Animation` class - allows configuring the duration (in milliseconds) and the curve of the animation, for example `animate_rotation=ft.animation.Animation(duration=300, curve="bounceOut")`. See [Curves](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/Curves-class.html) in Flutter docs for possible values. Default is `linear`.
-   `int` value - enables animation with specified duration in milliseconds and `linear` curve.
-   `bool` value - enables animation with the duration of 1000 milliseconds and `linear` curve.

### Opacity animation[​](/docs/cookbook/animations#opacity-animation "Direct link to Opacity animation")

Setting control's `animate_opacity` to either `True`, number or an instance of `animation.Animation` class (see above) enables implicit animation of [`Control.opacity`](/docs/controls#opacity) property.

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    c = ft.Container(        width=150,        height=150,        bgcolor="blue",        border_radius=10,        animate_opacity=300,    )    def animate_opacity(e):        c.opacity = 0 if c.opacity == 1 else 1        c.update()    page.add(        c,        ft.ElevatedButton(            "Animate opacity",            on_click=animate_opacity,        ),    )ft.app(main)
```

### Rotation animation[​](/docs/cookbook/animations#rotation-animation "Direct link to Rotation animation")

Setting control's `animate_rotation` to either `True`, number or an instance of `animation.Animation` class (see above) enables implicit animation of [`Control.rotate`](/docs/controls#rotate) property.

![](https://flet.dev/docs/cookbook/animations/img/docs/getting-started/animations/animate-rotation.gif)

```
from math import piimport flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    c = ft.Container(        width=100,        height=70,        bgcolor="blue",        border_radius=5,        rotate=ft.transform.Rotate(0, alignment=ft.alignment.center),        animate_rotation=ft.animation.Animation(300, ft.AnimationCurve.BOUNCE_OUT),    )    def animate(e):        c.rotate.angle += pi / 2        page.update()    page.vertical_alignment = ft.MainAxisAlignment.CENTER    page.horizontal_alignment = ft.CrossAxisAlignment.CENTER    page.spacing = 30    page.add(        c,        ft.ElevatedButton("Animate!", on_click=animate),    )ft.app(main)
```

### Scale animation[​](/docs/cookbook/animations#scale-animation "Direct link to Scale animation")

Setting control's `animate_scale` to either `True`, number or an instance of `animation.Animation` class (see above) enables implicit animation of [`Control.scale`](/docs/controls#scale) property.

![](https://flet.dev/docs/cookbook/animations/img/docs/getting-started/animations/animate-scale.gif)

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    c = ft.Container(        width=100,        height=100,        bgcolor="blue",        border_radius=5,        scale=ft.transform.Scale(scale=1),        animate_scale=ft.animation.Animation(600, ft.AnimationCurve.BOUNCE_OUT),    )    def animate(e):        c.scale = 2        page.update()    page.vertical_alignment = ft.MainAxisAlignment.CENTER    page.horizontal_alignment = ft.CrossAxisAlignment.CENTER    page.spacing = 30    page.add(        c,        ft.ElevatedButton("Animate!", on_click=animate),    )ft.app(main)
```

### Offset animation[​](/docs/cookbook/animations#offset-animation "Direct link to Offset animation")

Setting control's `animate_offset` to either `True`, number or an instance of `animation.Animation` class (see above) enables implicit animation of `Control.offset` property.

`offset` property is an instance of `transform.Offset` class which specifies horizontal `x` and vertical `y` offset of a control scaled to control's size. For example, an offset `transform.Offset(-0.25, 0)` will result in a horizontal translation of one quarter the width of the control.

Offset animation is used for various sliding effects:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/cookbook/animations/img/docs/getting-started/animations/animate-offset.gif)

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    c = ft.Container(        width=150,        height=150,        bgcolor="blue",        border_radius=10,        offset=ft.transform.Offset(-2, 0),        animate_offset=ft.animation.Animation(1000),    )    def animate(e):        c.offset = ft.transform.Offset(0, 0)        c.update()    page.add(        c,        ft.ElevatedButton("Reveal!", on_click=animate),    )ft.app(main)
```

### Position animation[​](/docs/cookbook/animations#position-animation "Direct link to Position animation")

Setting control's `animate_position` to either `True`, number or an instance of `animation.Animation` class (see above) enables implicit animation of [Control's `left`, `top`, `right` and `bottom` properties](/docs/controls#left).

Please note Control position works inside `Stack` control only.

![](https://flet.dev/docs/cookbook/animations/img/docs/getting-started/animations/animate-position.gif)

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    c1 = ft.Container(width=50, height=50, bgcolor="red", animate_position=1000)    c2 = ft.Container(        width=50, height=50, bgcolor="green", top=60, left=0, animate_position=500    )    c3 = ft.Container(        width=50, height=50, bgcolor="blue", top=120, left=0, animate_position=1000    )    def animate_container(e):        c1.top = 20        c1.left = 200        c2.top = 100        c2.left = 40        c3.top = 180        c3.left = 100        page.update()    page.add(        ft.Stack([c1, c2, c3], height=250),        ft.ElevatedButton("Animate!", on_click=animate_container),    )ft.app(main)
```

### Animated container[​](/docs/cookbook/animations#animated-container "Direct link to Animated container")

Setting [`Container.animate`](/docs/controls/container#animate) to either `True`, number or an instance of `animation.Animation` class (see above) enables implicit animation of container properties such as size, background color, border style, gradient.

![](https://flet.dev/docs/cookbook/animations/img/docs/getting-started/animations/animate-container.gif)

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    c = ft.Container(        width=150,        height=150,        bgcolor="red",        animate=ft.animation.Animation(1000, ft.AnimationCurve.BOUNCE_OUT),    )    def animate_container(e):        c.width = 100 if c.width == 150 else 150        c.height = 50 if c.height == 150 else 150        c.bgcolor = "blue" if c.bgcolor == "red" else "red"        c.update()    page.add(c, ft.ElevatedButton("Animate container", on_click=animate_container))ft.app(main)
```

### Animated content switcher[​](/docs/cookbook/animations#animated-content-switcher "Direct link to Animated content switcher")

[`AnimatedSwitcher`](/docs/controls/animatedswitcher) allows animated transition between a new control and the control previously set on the AnimatedSwitcher as a `content`.

![](https://flet.dev/docs/cookbook/animations/img/docs/getting-started/animations/animated-switcher-images.gif)

```
import timeimport flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    i = ft.Image(src="https://picsum.photos/150/150", width=150, height=150)    def animate(e):        sw.content = ft.Image(            src=f"https://picsum.photos/150/150?{time.time()}", width=150, height=150        )        page.update()    sw = ft.AnimatedSwitcher(        i,        transition=ft.AnimatedSwitcherTransition.SCALE,        duration=500,        reverse_duration=500,        switch_in_curve=ft.AnimationCurve.BOUNCE_OUT,        switch_out_curve=ft.AnimationCurve.BOUNCE_IN,    )    page.add(        sw,        ft.ElevatedButton("Animate!", on_click=animate),    )ft.app(main)
```

### Animation end callback[​](/docs/cookbook/animations#animation-end-callback "Direct link to Animation end callback")

All controls with `animate_*` properties have `on_animation_end` event handler which is called when animation complete and can be used to chain multiple animations.

Event's object `data` field contains the name of animation:

-   `opacity`
-   `rotation`
-   `scale`
-   `offset`
-   `position`
-   `container`

For example:

```
 c = ft.Container(        ft.Text("Animate me!"),        # ...        animate=ft.animation.Animation(1000, "bounceOut"),        on_animation_end=lambda e: print("Container animation end:", e.data)    )
```

# Authentication

You can implement user authentication ("Login with X" buttons) in your Flet app using 3rd-party identity providers such as GitHub, Google, Azure, Auth0, LinkedIn and others.

Identity provider must support [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authorization-code-flow) to retrieve API access token.

Built-in Flet login with credentials and user management is planned for future releases. If you have a requirement to create and manage user accounts in your app you can implement it by your own or use [Auth0](https://auth0.com/user-management) identity provider which provides a generous free tier.

Flet authentication features:

-   Works with Flet desktop, web and mobile apps.
-   Using multiple authentication providers in one app.
-   Built-in OAuth providers with automatic user details fetching:
    -   GitHub
    -   Azure
    -   Google
    -   Auth0
-   Optional groups fetching.
-   Automatic token refresh.
-   Login with a saved token ("Remember me").
-   Custom OAuth providers.

## Login process overview[​](/docs/cookbook/authentication#login-process-overview "Direct link to Login process overview")

-   Configure OAuth provider (built-in or generic) with Client ID, Client secret, Redirect URL.
-   Call `page.login(provider)` to initiate OAuth web flow.
-   User is being redirected to OAuth provider website.
-   On provider website user signs in and gives consent to access service API with requested scopes.
-   Provider website redirects to Flet's OAuth callback URL with authorization code.
-   Flet exchanges authorization code for a token and calls `page.on_login` event handler.
-   Flet app can retrieve API token from `page.auth.token` property and user details from `page.auth.user`.

## Configuring OAuth provider[​](/docs/cookbook/authentication#configuring-oauth-provider "Direct link to Configuring OAuth provider")

Flet has the following built-in OAuth providers:

-   GitHub
-   Azure
-   Google
-   Auth0

Additionally, you can configure a generic OAuth provider and provide authorization, token and user info endpoints.

In this guide we will configure Flet login page with GitHub account.

To integrate Flet authentication with GitHub a new [GitHub OAuth app](https://github.com/settings/developers) should be registered first (**Profile settings** → **Developer settings** → **OAuth Apps**).

**Authorization callback URL** should be in the format:

```
{application-url}/oauth_callback
```

![](https://flet.dev/docs/cookbook/authentication/img/docs/getting-started/authentication/github-new-oauth-app.png)

On OAuth app details page click "Generate a new client secret" button. Copy "Client ID" and "Client secret" values to a safe place - you'll need them in a Flet app.

![](https://flet.dev/docs/cookbook/authentication/img/docs/getting-started/authentication/github-oauth-app-details.png)

## Sign in with OAuth provider[​](/docs/cookbook/authentication#sign-in-with-oauth-provider "Direct link to Sign in with OAuth provider")

```
import osimport flet as ftfrom flet.auth.providers import GitHubOAuthProviderGITHUB_CLIENT_ID = os.getenv("GITHUB_CLIENT_ID")assert GITHUB_CLIENT_ID, "set GITHUB_CLIENT_ID environment variable"GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET = os.getenv("GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET")assert GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET, "set GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET environment variable"def main(page: ft.Page):    provider = GitHubOAuthProvider(        client_id=GITHUB_CLIENT_ID,        client_secret=GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET,        redirect_url="http://localhost:8550/oauth_callback",    )    def login_click(e):        page.login(provider)    def on_login(e):        print("Login error:", e.error)        print("Access token:", page.auth.token.access_token)        print("User ID:", page.auth.user.id)    page.on_login = on_login    page.add(ft.ElevatedButton("Login with GitHub", on_click=login_click))ft.app(main, port=8550, view=ft.WEB_BROWSER)
```

caution

Notice, we are fetching OAuth app client ID and client secret from an environment variables. Do not embed any secrets into source code to avoid accidental exposure to a public!

Before running the app set the secret environment variables in a command line:

```
$ export GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="<client_id>"$ export GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="<client_secret>"
```

Run the program and click "Login with GitHub" button. GitHub authorize app page will be opened in:

-   **Desktop** app - a new browser window or tab.
-   **Web** app - a new popup window (make sure popup blocker is off).
-   **Mobile** app - an in-app web browser.

![](https://flet.dev/docs/cookbook/authentication/img/docs/getting-started/authentication/github-oauth-authorize.png)

### Redirect URL[​](/docs/cookbook/authentication#redirect-url "Direct link to Redirect URL")

We used `http://localhost:8550/oauth_callback` as a redirect URL while registering GitHub OAuth app. Notice it has a fixed port `8550`. To run your Flet app on a fixed port use `port` argument in `flet.app` call:

```
ft.app(main, port=8550)
```

### Scope[​](/docs/cookbook/authentication#scope "Direct link to Scope")

Most of OAuth providers allows applications to request one or more scopes to limit application's access to a user's account.

Built-in Flet providers, by default, request scopes to access user profile, but you can request additional scopes in login method, like `public_repo` in the example above:

```
page.login(    provider,    scope=["public_repo"])
```

`page.login()` method has a number of arguments to control authentication process:

-   `fetch_user` (bool) - whether to fetch user details into `page.auth.user`. Default is `True`.
-   `fetch_groups` (bool) - whether to fetch user groups into `page.auth.user.groups`. Default is `False`.
-   `scope` - a list of scopes to request.
-   `saved_token` - a JSON snapshot of `page.auth.token` to restore authorization from. Token can be serialized with `page.auth.token.to_json()`, encrypted and saved in [`page.client_storage`](/docs/cookbook/client-storage). See below.
-   `on_open_authorization_url` - a callback to open a browser with authorization URL. See below.
-   `complete_page_html` - a custom HTML contents of "You've been successfully authenticated. Close this page now" page.
-   `redirect_to_page` (bool) - used with Flet web app only when authorization page is opened in the same browser tab.

The result of `page.login()` call is an instance of `Authorization` class with the following fields:

-   **`token`** - OAuth token used to access provider's API. See below.
-   **`user`** - user details with a mandatory `id` field and other fields specific to OAuth provider.
-   **`provider`** - an instance of OAuth provider used for authorization.

A reference to the last authorization is saved in `page.auth` property.

If your app allows authorizations with multiple OAuth providers you can save authorizations in a session, for example:

```
page.session["github_auth"] = page.login(github_provider)page.session["google_auth"] = page.login(google_provider)
```

### Checking authentication results[​](/docs/cookbook/authentication#checking-authentication-results "Direct link to Checking authentication results")

Upon successful or failed authorization `page.on_login` event handler is called.

Event handler argument `e` is an instance of `LoginEvent` class with the following properties:

-   `error` (str) - OAuth error.
-   `error_description` (str) - OAuth error description.

Authorization was successful if `error` is an empty string.

You can use this event handler to toggle signed in/out UI, for example:

```
import osimport fletfrom flet import ElevatedButton, LoginEvent, Pagefrom flet.auth.providers import GitHubOAuthProviderdef main(page: Page):    provider = GitHubOAuthProvider(        client_id=os.getenv("GITHUB_CLIENT_ID"),        client_secret=os.getenv("GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET"),        redirect_url="http://localhost:8550/oauth_callback",    )    def login_button_click(e):        page.login(provider, scope=["public_repo"])    def on_login(e: LoginEvent):        if not e.error:            toggle_login_buttons()    def logout_button_click(e):        page.logout()    def on_logout(e):        toggle_login_buttons()    def toggle_login_buttons():        login_button.visible = page.auth is None        logout_button.visible = page.auth is not None        page.update()    login_button = ElevatedButton("Login with GitHub", on_click=login_button_click)    logout_button = ElevatedButton("Logout", on_click=logout_button_click)    toggle_login_buttons()    page.on_login = on_login    page.on_logout = on_logout    page.add(login_button, logout_button)flet.app(main, port=8550, view=flet.WEB_BROWSER)
```

## Accessing user details[​](/docs/cookbook/authentication#accessing-user-details "Direct link to Accessing user details")

If `page.login()` method is called with `fetch_user=True` (default) a user profile will be assigned to `page.auth.user`.

All built-in OAuth providers implement `user.id` property - unique user identifier - which value depends on the provider (a number, Guid or email) and can be used in your app as a user key.

The rest of user profile properties depends on provider and can be accessed with an indexer. For example, to print some properties of GitHub user:

```
print("Name:", page.auth.user["name"])print("Login:", page.auth.user["login"])print("Email:", page.auth.user["email"])
```

## Using OAuth token[​](/docs/cookbook/authentication#using-oauth-token "Direct link to Using OAuth token")

Upon successful authorization `page.auth.token` will contain OAuth token that can be used to access providers's API. Token object has the following properties:

-   `access_token` - access token used as an authorization token in API request header.
-   `scope` - token's scope.
-   `token_type` - access token type, e.g. `Bearer`.
-   `expires_in` - optional number of seconds when access token expires.
-   `expires_at` - optional time (`time.time()` + `expires_in`) when access token expires.
-   `refresh_token` - optional refresh token which is used to get a new access token, when the old one expires.

Usually, only `page.auth.token.access_token` is needed to call provider's API, for example to list user's GitHub repositories:

```
import requestsheaders = {"Authorization": "Bearer {}".format(page.auth.token.access_token)}repos_resp = requests.get("https://api.github.com/user/repos", headers=headers)user_repos = json.loads(repos_resp.text)for repo in user_repos:    print(repo["full_name"])
```

note

Do not save a reference to `page.auth.token` somewhere in your code, but rather call `page.auth.token` every time you need to grab access token. `page.auth.token` is a property which automatically refreshes OAuth token if/when it expires.

Correct code:

```
access_token = page.auth.token.access_token
```

Wrong code:

```
token = page.auth.token# some other codeaccess_token = token.access_token # token could expire by this moment
```

## Saving and restoring an auth token[​](/docs/cookbook/authentication#saving-and-restoring-an-auth-token "Direct link to Saving and restoring an auth token")

To implement persistent login ("Remember me" checkbox on login page) you can save auth token in a [client storage](/docs/cookbook/client-storage) and use it to login next time a user opens your Flet app.

To serialize auth token to JSON:

```
jt = page.auth.token.to_json()
```

caution

Encrypt sensitive data before sending it to a client storage.

Flet includes utility methods for encrypting text data using symmetric algorithm (where the same key is used for encryption and decryption). They use [Fernet](https://github.com/fernet/spec/blob/master/Spec.md) implementation from [cryptography](https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/) package, which is AES 128 with some additional hardening, plus PBKDF2 to derive encryption key from a user passphrase.

To encrypt JSON token:

```
import osfrom flet.security import encrypt, decryptsecret_key = os.getenv("MY_APP_SECRET_KEY")# returns base64-encoded stringejt = encrypt(jt, secret_key)
```

caution

Notice, we are fetching a secret key (aka passphrase, password, etc.) from an environment variable. Do not embed any secrets into source code to avoid accidental exposure to a public!

Before running the app set the secret in a command line:

```
$ export MY_APP_SECRET_KEY="<secret>"
```

Now, encrypted value can be stored in a client storage:

```
page.client_storage.set("myapp.auth_token", ejt)
```

Next time a user opens the app you can read encrypted token from a client storage and, if it exists, decrypt it and use in `page.login()` method:

```
ejt = page.client_storage.get("myapp.auth_token")if ejt:    jt = decrypt(ejt, secret_key)    page.login(provider, saved_token=jt)
```

[See complete app example](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/main/python/apps/authentication/github-oauth-with-listing-repos.py).

## Signing out[​](/docs/cookbook/authentication#signing-out "Direct link to Signing out")

Calling `page.logout()` resets `page.auth` reference and triggers `page.on_logout` event handlers.

You can remove saved token in logout method, for example:

```
def logout_button_click(e):    page.client_storage.remove(AUTH_TOKEN_KEY)    page.logout()
```

[See complete app example](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/main/python/apps/authentication/github-oauth-with-listing-repos.py).

## Customizing authorization flow[​](/docs/cookbook/authentication#customizing-authorization-flow "Direct link to Customizing authorization flow")

By default, OAuth authorization flow is happening in either new browser window/tab (desktop app), browser popup window (web) or in-app web view (mobile).

Upon completion of authorization flow a user is redirected to Flet's OAuth callback page (`/oauth_callback`) which tries to close a browser window/tab with JavaScript and provides user with instructions to close the window manually if JavaScript close didn't work.

This section is applicable to Flet desktop and web apps only as in-app web view in mobile apps can be closed by Flet without relying on JavaScript.

You can customize the contents of "Authorization complete" page in `page.login()` method, for example:

```
complete_page_html = """<!DOCTYPE html><html>  <head>    <title>Signed in to MyApp</title>  </head><body>  <script type="text/javascript">      window.close();  </script>  <p>You've been successfully signed in! You can close this tab or window now.</p></body></html>"""page.login(    provider,    complete_page_html=complete_page_html,)
```

You can also change web app to open provider's authorization page in the same tab which might be more familiar to your users and save them from dealing with popup blockers:

```
page.login(    provider,    on_open_authorization_url=lambda url: page.launch_url(url, web_window_name="_self"),    redirect_to_page=True)
```

To open flow in a new tab (notice `_self` replaced with `_blank`):

```
page.login(    provider,    on_open_authorization_url=lambda url: page.launch_url(url, web_window_name="_blank"))
```

## Configuring a custom OAuth provider[​](/docs/cookbook/authentication#configuring-a-custom-oauth-provider "Direct link to Configuring a custom OAuth provider")

You can configure any OAuth-compatible authentication provider in your app with `flet.auth.oauth_provider.OAuthProvider` class.

Following the instructions in [LinkedIn Authorization Code Flow guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/authentication/authorization-code-flow?context=linkedin%2Fcontext&tabs=HTTPS) we are able to get all required parameters to configure LinkedIn OAuth provider to allow users of your Flet app to login with their LinkedIn accounts:

```
import osimport fletfrom flet import ElevatedButton, Pagefrom flet.auth import OAuthProviderdef main(page: Page):    provider = OAuthProvider(        client_id=os.getenv("LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID"),        client_secret=os.getenv("LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET"),        authorization_endpoint="https://www.linkedin.com/oauth/v2/authorization",        token_endpoint="https://www.linkedin.com/oauth/v2/accessToken",        user_endpoint="https://api.linkedin.com/v2/me",        user_scopes=["r_liteprofile", "r_emailaddress"],        user_id_fn=lambda u: u["id"],        redirect_url="http://localhost:8550/oauth_callback",    )    def login_click(e):        page.login(provider)    def on_login(e):        if e.error:            raise Exception(e.error)        print("User ID:", page.auth.user.id)        print("Access token:", page.auth.token.access_token)    page.on_login = on_login    page.add(ElevatedButton("Login with LinkedIn", on_click=login_click))flet.app(main, port=8550, view=flet.WEB_BROWSER)
```

Mandatory provider settings:

-   `client_id`
-   `client_secret`
-   `authorization_endpoint`
-   `token_endpoint`
-   `redirect_url`

Similar to other examples client ID and client secret are fetched from environment variables.

## Overview[​](/docs/cookbook/assets#overview "Direct link to Overview")

Flet apps can include both code and assets/resources. An asset is a file that is bundled and deployed with your app and is accessible at runtime. Common types of assets include static data (e.g., JSON files), configuration files, icons, images, videos, etc.

To use relative paths for your asset files, you need to provide a path to your assets directory when launching your app with the `ft.app()` function. The parameter for this is called `assets_dir`, which defaults to `"assets"`. This parameter specifies the folder where local assets are stored and can be either an absolute path or a path relative to the app's entry point file, such as `main.py`.

## Example: Displaying a Local Image[​](/docs/cookbook/assets#example-displaying-a-local-image "Direct link to Example: Displaying a Local Image")

Suppose you have a folder named `assets` in the same directory as your `main.py` file, and this folder contains an image file named `sample.png` in a subfolder called `images`:

```
/assets    /images         /sample.pngmain.py
```

To display this image in your app, you can do the following:

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    page.add(        ft.Image(src="images/sample.png")    )ft.app(main, assets_dir="assets")
```

The same approach applies to other asset types like fonts, Lottie animations, Rive files, etc.

# Fonts

## System fonts[​](/docs/cookbook/fonts#system-fonts "Direct link to System fonts")

You can use the (system) fonts installed on your computer, e.g. "Consolas", "Arial", "Verdana", "Tahoma", etc.

Limitation

System fonts cannot be used in Flet web apps rendered with ["canvas kit"](/docs/reference/types/webrenderer#canvas_kit).

### Usage Example[​](/docs/cookbook/fonts#usage-example "Direct link to Usage Example")

The following example demonstrates how to use the "Consolas" font in a Flet application.

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    page.add(        ft.Text(            value="This text is rendered with Consolas font",            font_family="Consolas"        )    )ft.app(main)
```

## Importing Fonts[​](/docs/cookbook/fonts#importing-fonts "Direct link to Importing Fonts")

Font can be imported from external resource by providing an absolute URL or from application assets directory (see [Assets Guide](/docs/cookbook/assets)).

This is done by setting the page's [`fonts`](/docs/controls/page#fonts) property.

To apply one of the imported fonts, you can:

-   Use [`Theme.font_family`](/docs/reference/types/theme#font_family) to set a default/fallback app-wide font family.
-   Specify a font for individual controls. For example, [`Text.font_family`](/docs/controls/text#font_family).

### Usage Example[​](/docs/cookbook/fonts#usage-example-1 "Direct link to Usage Example")

The example below loads the "Kanit" font from GitHub and "Open Sans" from local assets. "Kanit" is set as the default app font, while "Open Sans" is applied to a specific `Text` control.

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    page.fonts = {        "Kanit": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/fonts/master/ofl/kanit/Kanit-Bold.ttf",        "Open Sans": "/fonts/OpenSans-Regular.ttf"    }    page.theme = Theme(font_family="Kanit")  # Default app font    page.add(        ft.Text("This text uses the Kanit font"),        ft.Text("This text uses the Open Sans font", font_family="Open Sans")    )ft.app(main, assets_dir="assets")
```

### Static and Variable Fonts[​](/docs/cookbook/fonts#static-and-variable-fonts "Direct link to Static and Variable Fonts")

Currently, only [static fonts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Fonts/Variable_Fonts_Guide#standard_or_static_fonts) are supported. These fonts have a specific width, weight, or style combination (e.g., "Open Sans Regular").

Support for [variable fonts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Fonts/Variable_Fonts_Guide#variable_fonts) is in progress.

However, to use variable fonts, you can create static instances at specific weights using [fonttools](https://pypi.org/project/fonttools/), e.g.:

```
fonttools varLib.mutator ./YourVariableFont-VF.ttf wght=140 wdth=85
```

To explore available font features (e.g. possible options for `wght`) use [Wakamai Fondue](https://wakamaifondue.com/beta/) online tool.

# Client storage

Flet's client storage API allows storing key-value data on a client side in a persistent storage. Flet implementation uses [`shared_preferences`](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences) Flutter package.

The actual storage mechanism depends on a platform where Flet app is running:

-   Web - [Local storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage).
-   Desktop - JSON file.
-   iOS - [NSUserDefaults](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuserdefaults).
-   Android - [SharedPreferences](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/SharedPreferences).

Writing data to the storage:

```
# stringspage.client_storage.set("key", "value")# numbers, booleanspage.client_storage.set("number.setting", 12345)page.client_storage.set("bool_setting", True)# listspage.client_storage.set("favorite_colors", ["red", "green", "blue"])
```

note

Each Flutter application using `shared_preferences` plugin has its own set of preferences. As the same Flet client (which is a Flutter app) is used to run UI for multiple Flet apps any values stored in one Flet application are visible/available to another Flet app running by the same user.

To distinguish one application settings from another it is recommended to use some unique prefix for all storage keys, for example `{company}.{product}.`. For example to store auth token in one app you could use `acme.one_app.auth_token` key and in another app use `acme.second_app.auth_token`.

caution

It is responsibility of Flet app developer to encrypt sensitive data before sending it to a client storage, so it's not read/tampered by another app or an app user.

Reading data:

```
# The value is automatically converted back to the original typevalue = page.client_storage.get("key")colors = page.client_storage.get("favorite_colors")# colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]
```

Check if a key exists:

```
page.client_storage.contains_key("key") # True if the key exists
```

Get all keys:

```
page.client_storage.get_keys("key-prefix.")
```

Remove a value:

```
page.client_storage.remove("key")
```

Clear the storage:

```
page.client_storage.clear()
```

caution

`clear()` is a dangerous function that removes all preferences of all Flet apps ever run by the same user and serves as a heads-up that permanent application data shouldn't be stored in the client storage.

# Session storage

Flet provides an API for storing key-value data in user's session on a server side.

Writing data to the session:

```
# stringspage.session.set("key", "value")# numbers, booleanspage.session.set("number.setting", 12345)page.session.set("bool_setting", True)# listspage.session.set("favorite_colors", ["red", "green", "blue"])
```

caution

In the current Flet implementation the data stored in a session store is transient and is not preserved between app restarts.

Reading data:

```
# The value is automatically converted back to the original typevalue = page.session.get("key")colors = page.session.get("favorite_colors")# colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]
```

Check if a key exists:

```
page.session.contains_key("key") # True if the key exists
```

Get all keys:

```
page.session.get_keys()
```

Remove a value:

```
page.session.remove("key")
```

Clear the session storage:

```
page.session.clear()
```

# Encrypting sensitive data

Sensitive data such as tokens, keys, credit card numbers and other "secrets" must be stored at rest (database, files, [client storage](/docs/cookbook/client-storage)) in encrypted form to avoid data breaches.

Flet includes utility methods to encrypt and decrypt sensitive text data using symmetric algorithm (where the same key is used for encryption and decryption). They use [Fernet](https://github.com/fernet/spec/blob/master/Spec.md) implementation from [cryptography](https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/) package, which is AES 128 with some additional hardening, plus PBKDF2 to derive encryption key from a user passphrase.

## Secret key[​](/docs/cookbook/encrypting-sensitive-data#secret-key "Direct link to Secret key")

Encryption secret key (aka password, or passphrase) is an arbitrary password-like string configured by a user and used for encrypting and decrypting data. Crypto algorithm uses secret key to "derive" encryption key (32 bytes).

danger

Do not embed any secrets into the source code to avoid accidental exposure to the public!

You can provide a secret to your app via environment variable:

```
import ossecret_key = os.getenv("MY_APP_SECRET_KEY")
```

Before running the app set the secret in a command line:

```
$ export MY_APP_SECRET_KEY="<secret>"
```

note

While passing secrets via environment variables is a common practice amongst developers and service providers it does not fully prevent secrets leaking in some environments. Other mechanisms can be used to inject secrets to your application such as mounting secret files or vault services.

## Encrypting data[​](/docs/cookbook/encrypting-sensitive-data#encrypting-data "Direct link to Encrypting data")

Use `encrypt()` method to encrypt a string:

```
import osfrom flet.security import encrypt, decryptsecret_key = os.getenv("MY_APP_SECRET_KEY")plain_text = "This is a secret message!"encrypted_data = encrypt(plain_text, secret_key)
```

`encrypted_data` is a URL-safe base64-encoded string.

`encrypt` accepts strings only, so any objects must be serialized to JSON, XML or other text-based format before encryption.

## Decrypting data[​](/docs/cookbook/encrypting-sensitive-data#decrypting-data "Direct link to Decrypting data")

Use `decrypt()` method to decrypt the data:

```
import osfrom flet.security import encrypt, decryptsecret_key = os.getenv("MY_APP_SECRET_KEY")encrypted_data = "601llp2zpPp4QjBWe2cOwGdBQUFBQUJqTTFJbmgyWU5jblVp..."plain_text = decrypt(encrypted_data, secret_key)print(plain_text)
```

# PubSub

If you build a chat app using Flet you need somehow to pass user messages between sessions. When a user sends a message it should be broadcasted to all other app sessions and displayed on their pages.

Flet provides a simple built-in PubSub mechanism for asynchronous communication between page sessions.

Flet PubSub allows broadcasting messages to all app sessions or sending only to specific "topic" (or "channel") subscribers.

A typical PubSub usage would be:

-   [subscribe](/docs/controls/page#subscribehandler) to broadcast messages or [subscribe to a topic](/docs/controls/page#subscribe_topictopic-handler) on app session start.
-   [send](/docs/controls/page#send_allmessage) broadcast message or [send to a topic](/docs/controls/page#send_all_on_topictopic-message) on some event, like "Send" button click.
-   [unsubscribe](/docs/controls/page#unsubscribe) from broadcast messages or [unsubscribe from a topic](/docs/controls/page#unsubscribe_topictopic) on some event, like "Leave" button click.
-   [unsubscribe](/docs/controls/page#unsubscribe_all) from everything on [`page.on_close`](/docs/controls/page#on_close).

This is an example of a simple chat application:

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    page.title = "Flet Chat"    # subscribe to broadcast messages    def on_message(msg):        messages.controls.append(ft.Text(msg))        page.update()    page.pubsub.subscribe(on_message)    def send_click(e):        page.pubsub.send_all(f"{user.value}: {message.value}")        # clean up the form        message.value = ""        page.update()    messages = ft.Column()    user = ft.TextField(hint_text="Your name", width=150)    message = ft.TextField(hint_text="Your message...", expand=True)  # fill all the space    send = ft.ElevatedButton("Send", on_click=send_click)    page.add(messages, ft.Row(controls=[user, message, send]))ft.app(main, view=ft.AppView.WEB_BROWSER)
```

# Control Refs

Flet controls are objects and to access their properties we need to keep references (variables) to those objects.

Consider the following example:

```
import flet as ftdef main(page):    first_name = ft.TextField(label="First name", autofocus=True)    last_name = ft.TextField(label="Last name")    greetings = ft.Column()    def btn_click(e):        greetings.controls.append(ft.Text(f"Hello, {first_name.value} {last_name.value}!"))        first_name.value = ""        last_name.value = ""        page.update()        first_name.focus()    page.add(        first_name,        last_name,        ft.ElevatedButton("Say hello!", on_click=btn_click),        greetings,    )ft.app(main)
```

In the very beginning of `main()` method we create three controls which we are going to use in button's `on_click` handler: two `TextField` for first and last names and a `Column` - container for greeting messages. We create controls with all their properties set and in the end of `main()` method, in `page.add()` call, we use their references (variables).

When more and more controls and event handlers are added it becomes challenging to keep all control definitions in one place, so they become scattered across `main()` body. Glancing at `page.add()` parameters it's hard to imagine (without constant jumping to variable definitions in IDE) what would the end form look like:

```
    page.add(        first_name,        last_name,        ft.ElevatedButton("Say hello!", on_click=btn_click),        greetings,    )
```

Is `first_name` a TextField, does it have autofocus set? Is greetings a `Row` or a `Column`?

## `Ref` class[​](/docs/cookbook/control-refs#ref-class "Direct link to ref-class")

Flet provides `Ref` utility class which allows to define a reference to the control, use that reference in event handlers and set the reference to a real control later, while building a tree. The idea comes from [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html).

To define a new typed control reference:

```
first_name = ft.Ref[ft.TextField]()
```

To access referenced control (control de-reference) use `Ref.current` property:

```
# empty first namefirst_name.current.value = ""
```

To assign control to a reference set `Control.ref` property to a reference:

```
page.add(    ft.TextField(ref=first_name, label="First name", autofocus=True))
```

note

All Flet controls have `ref` property.

We could re-write our program to use references:

```
import flet as ftdef main(page):    first_name = ft.Ref[ft.TextField]()    last_name = ft.Ref[ft.TextField]()    greetings = ft.Ref[ft.Column]()    def btn_click(e):        greetings.current.controls.append(            ft.Text(f"Hello, {first_name.current.value} {last_name.current.value}!")        )        first_name.current.value = ""        last_name.current.value = ""        page.update()        first_name.current.focus()    page.add(        ft.TextField(ref=first_name, label="First name", autofocus=True),        ft.TextField(ref=last_name, label="Last name"),        ft.ElevatedButton("Say hello!", on_click=btn_click),        ft.Column(ref=greetings),    )ft.app(main)
```

Now we can clearly see in `page.add()` the structure of the page and all the controls it's built of.

Yes, the logic becomes a little bit more verbose as you need to add `.current.` to access ref's control, but it's a matter of personal preference :)

# Accessibility

Flet is based on Flutter which includes first-class framework support for accessibility in addition to that provided by the underlying operating system.

## Screen readers[​](/docs/cookbook/accessibility#screen-readers "Direct link to Screen readers")

For mobile, screen readers ([TalkBack](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6283677?hl=en), [VoiceOver](https://www.apple.com/lae/accessibility/iphone/vision/)) enable visually impaired users to get spoken feedback about the contents of the screen and interact with the UI via gestures on mobile and keyboard shortcuts on desktop. Turn on VoiceOver or TalkBack on your mobile device and navigate around your app.

For web, the following screen readers are currently supported:

Mobile Browsers:

-   iOS - VoiceOver
-   Android - TalkBack

Desktop Browsers:

-   MacOS - VoiceOver
-   Windows - JAWs & NVDA

Screen Readers users on web will need to toggle "Enable accessibility" button to build the semantics tree.

### Text[​](/docs/cookbook/accessibility#text "Direct link to Text")

Use `Text.semantics_label` property to override default Text control semantics.

### Buttons[​](/docs/cookbook/accessibility#buttons "Direct link to Buttons")

All buttons with text on them generate proper semantics.

Use `tooltip` property to add screen reader semantics for `IconButton`, `FloatingActionButton` and `PopupMenuButton` buttons.

### `TextField` and `Dropdown`[​](/docs/cookbook/accessibility#textfield-and-dropdown "Direct link to textfield-and-dropdown")

Use `TextField.label` and `Dropdown.label` properties to add screen reader semantics to those controls.

### Custom semantics[​](/docs/cookbook/accessibility#custom-semantics "Direct link to Custom semantics")

For any specific requirements use [`Semantics`](/docs/controls/semantics) control.

### Debugging semantics[​](/docs/cookbook/accessibility#debugging-semantics "Direct link to Debugging semantics")

Set `page.show_semantics_debugger` to `True` to show an overlay that shows the accessibility information reported by the framework.

You can implement a specific [keyboard shortcut](/docs/cookbook/keyboard-shortcuts) to conveniently toggle semantics debugger during app development:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/cookbook/accessibility/img/docs/getting-started/debug-accessibility-toggle.gif)

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    page.title = "Flet counter example"    page.vertical_alignment = ft.MainAxisAlignment.CENTER    page.horizontal_alignment = ft.CrossAxisAlignment.CENTER    def on_keyboard(e: ft.KeyboardEvent):        print(e)        if e.key == "S" and e.ctrl:            page.show_semantics_debugger = not page.show_semantics_debugger            page.update()    page.on_keyboard_event = on_keyboard    txt_number = ft.Text("0", size=40)    def button_click(e):        txt_number.value = str(int(txt_number.value) + 1)        page.update()    page.add(        txt_number,        ft.Text("Press CTRL+S to toggle semantics debugger"),        ft.FloatingActionButton(            icon=ft.Icons.ADD, tooltip="Increment number", on_click=button_click        ),    )ft.app(main, view=ft.AppView.WEB_BROWSER)
```

# Logging

This article explains how to control level of the logs messages generated by Flet library and its underlying components. You may need to enable detailed logging to troubleshoot Flet library or when submitting a new Flet issue.

## Python[​](/docs/cookbook/logging#python "Direct link to Python")

Flet Python modules expose named loggers: `flet_core` and `flet`.

To enable detailed/verbose Flet logging in your program add this code before calling `ft.app()`:

```
import logginglogging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

This will enable loggers across all Flet modules (`flet_core` and `flet`).

To reduce verbosity you may suppress logging messages from `flet_core` module, but adding:

```
logging.getLogger("flet_core").setLevel(logging.INFO)
```

Debug logging is usually needed for troubleshooting purposes, when submitting a new Flet issue.

In the most cases you should be fine with `INFO` logging level.

## Fletd server[​](/docs/cookbook/logging#fletd-server "Direct link to Fletd server")

You can control the logging of Fletd - built-in Flet web server.

When `flet` Python logger level is configured its value is implicitly passed to Fletd server and you can see its log messages in the output.

However, you can use `FLET_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to override Fletd log level: `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `debug`, `panic`, `fatal`.

Additionally, to redirect Flet logs output to a file you can set `FLET_LOG_TO_FILE` environment variable to `true`. Flet logs will be saved to `/tmp/flet-server.log` on macOS and Linux and to `%TEMP%\flet-server.log` on Windows.

# Create To-Do app in Python with Flet

In this tutorial we will show you, step-by-step, how to create a To-Do app in Python using Flet framework and then publish it as a desktop, mobile or web app. The app is a single-file console program of just [172 lines (formatted!) of Python code](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/main/python/apps/todo/todo.py), yet it is a multi-platform application with rich, responsive UI:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-todo/img/docs/tutorial/todo-complete-demo-web.gif)

You can see the live demo [here](https://gallery.flet.dev/todo/).

We chose a To-Do app for the tutorial, because it covers all of the basic concepts you would need to create a Flet app: building a page layout, adding controls, handling events, displaying and editing lists, making reusable UI components, and publishing options.

The tutorial consists of the following steps:

-   [Getting started with Flet](/docs/tutorials/python-todo#getting-started-with-flet)
-   [Adding page controls and handling events](/docs/tutorials/python-todo#adding-page-controls-and-handling-events)
-   [View, edit and delete list items](/docs/tutorials/python-todo#view-edit-and-delete-list-items)
-   [Filtering list items](/docs/tutorials/python-todo#filtering-list-items)
-   [Final touches](/docs/tutorials/python-todo#final-touches)
-   [Publishing the app](/docs/tutorials/python-todo#publishing-the-app)

## Getting started with Flet[​](/docs/tutorials/python-todo#getting-started-with-flet "Direct link to Getting started with Flet")

To create a multi-platform app in Python with Flet, you don't need to know HTML, CSS or JavaScript, but you do need a basic knowledge of Python and object-oriented programming.

Before you can create your first Flet app, you need to [setup your development environment](/docs/getting-started/), which requires Python 3.9 or above and `flet` package.

Once you have Flet installed, let's [create](/docs/getting-started/create-flet-app) a simple hello-world app.

Create `hello.py` with the following contents:

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    page.add(ft.Text(value="Hello, world!"))ft.app(main)
```

Run this app and you will see a new window with a greeting:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-todo/img/docs/tutorial/todo-app-hello-world.png)

## Adding page controls and handling events[​](/docs/tutorials/python-todo#adding-page-controls-and-handling-events "Direct link to Adding page controls and handling events")

Now we're ready to create a multi-user To-Do app.

To start, we'll need a [TextField](/docs/controls/textfield) for entering a task name, and an "+" [FloatingActionButton](/docs/controls/floatingactionbutton) with an event handler that will display a [Checkbox](/docs/controls/checkbox) with a new task.

Create `todo.py` with the following contents:

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    def add_clicked(e):        page.add(ft.Checkbox(label=new_task.value))        new_task.value = ""        page.update()    new_task = ft.TextField(hint_text="What's needs to be done?")    page.add(new_task, ft.FloatingActionButton(icon=ft.Icons.ADD, on_click=add_clicked))ft.app(main)
```

Run the app and you should see a page like this:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-todo/img/docs/tutorial/todo-app-1.png)

### Page layout[​](/docs/tutorials/python-todo#page-layout "Direct link to Page layout")

Now let's make the app look nice! We want the entire app to be at the top center of the page, taking up 600 px width. The TextField and the "+" button should be aligned horizontally, and take up full app width:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-todo/img/docs/tutorial/todo-diagram-1.svg)

[`Row`](/docs/controls/row) is a control that is used to lay its children controls out horizontally on a page. [`Column`](/docs/controls/column) is a control that is used to lay its children controls out vertically on a page.

Replace `todo.py` contents with the following:

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    def add_clicked(e):        tasks_view.controls.append(ft.Checkbox(label=new_task.value))        new_task.value = ""        view.update()    new_task = ft.TextField(hint_text="What needs to be done?", expand=True)    tasks_view = ft.Column()    view=ft.Column(        width=600,        controls=[            ft.Row(                controls=[                    new_task,                    ft.FloatingActionButton(icon=ft.Icons.ADD, on_click=add_clicked),                ],            ),            tasks_view,        ],    )    page.horizontal_alignment = ft.CrossAxisAlignment.CENTER    page.add(view)ft.app(main)
```

Run the app and you should see a page like this:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-todo/img/docs/tutorial/todo-app-2.png)

### Reusable UI components[​](/docs/tutorials/python-todo#reusable-ui-components "Direct link to Reusable UI components")

While we could continue writing our app in the `main` function, the best practice would be to create a [reusable UI component](/docs/getting-started/custom-controls). Imagine you are working on an app header, a side menu, or UI that will be a part of a larger project. Even if you can't think of such uses right now, we still recommend creating all your Flet apps with composability and reusability in mind.

To make a reusable To-Do app component, we are going to encapsulate its state and presentation logic in a separate class:

```
import flet as ftclass TodoApp(ft.Column):    # application's root control is a Column containing all other controls    def __init__(self):        super().__init__()        self.new_task = ft.TextField(hint_text="What needs to be done?", expand=True)        self.tasks_view = ft.Column()        self.width = 600        self.controls = [            ft.Row(                controls=[                    self.new_task,                    ft.FloatingActionButton(                        icon=ft.Icons.ADD, on_click=self.add_clicked                    ),                ],            ),            self.tasks_view,        ]    def add_clicked(self, e):        self.tasks_view.controls.append(ft.Checkbox(label=self.new_task.value))        self.new_task.value = ""        self.update()def main(page: ft.Page):    page.title = "To-Do App"    page.horizontal_alignment = ft.CrossAxisAlignment.CENTER    page.update()    # create application instance    todo = TodoApp()    # add application's root control to the page    page.add(todo)ft.app(main)
```

note

Try adding two `TodoApp` components to the page:

```
# create application instanceapp1 = TodoApp()app2 = TodoApp()# add application's root control to the pagepage.add(app1, app2)
```

## View, edit and delete list items[​](/docs/tutorials/python-todo#view-edit-and-delete-list-items "Direct link to View, edit and delete list items")

In the [previous step](/docs/tutorials/python-todo#adding-page-controls-and-handling-events), we created a basic To-Do app with task items shown as checkboxes. Let's improve the app by adding "Edit" and "Delete" buttons next to a task name. The "Edit" button will switch a task item to edit mode.

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-todo/img/docs/tutorial/todo-diagram-2.svg)

Each task item is represented by two rows: `display_view` row with Checkbox, "Edit" and "Delete" buttons and `edit_view` row with TextField and "Save" button. `view` column serves as a container for both `display_view` and `edit_view` rows.

Before this step, the code was short enough to be fully included in the tutorial. Going forward, we will be highlighting only the changes introduced in a step.

Copy the entire code for this step from [here](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/main/python/tutorials/todo/to-do-4.py). Below we will explain the changes we've done to implement view, edit, and delete tasks.

To encapsulate task item views and actions, we introduced a new `Task` class:

```
class Task(ft.Column):    def __init__(self, task_name, task_delete):        super().__init__()        self.task_name = task_name        self.task_delete = task_delete        self.display_task = ft.Checkbox(value=False, label=self.task_name)        self.edit_name = ft.TextField(expand=1)        self.display_view = ft.Row(            alignment=ft.MainAxisAlignment.SPACE_BETWEEN,            vertical_alignment=ft.CrossAxisAlignment.CENTER,            controls=[                self.display_task,                ft.Row(                    spacing=0,                    controls=[                        ft.IconButton(                            icon=ft.Icons.CREATE_OUTLINED,                            tooltip="Edit To-Do",                            on_click=self.edit_clicked,                        ),                        ft.IconButton(                            ft.Icons.DELETE_OUTLINE,                            tooltip="Delete To-Do",                            on_click=self.delete_clicked,                        ),                    ],                ),            ],        )        self.edit_view = ft.Row(            visible=False,            alignment=ft.MainAxisAlignment.SPACE_BETWEEN,            vertical_alignment=ft.CrossAxisAlignment.CENTER,            controls=[                self.edit_name,                ft.IconButton(                    icon=ft.Icons.DONE_OUTLINE_OUTLINED,                    icon_color=ft.Colors.GREEN,                    tooltip="Update To-Do",                    on_click=self.save_clicked,                ),            ],        )        self.controls = [self.display_view, self.edit_view]    def edit_clicked(self, e):        self.edit_name.value = self.display_task.label        self.display_view.visible = False        self.edit_view.visible = True        self.update()    def save_clicked(self, e):        self.display_task.label = self.edit_name.value        self.display_view.visible = True        self.edit_view.visible = False        self.update()    def delete_clicked(self, e):        self.task_delete(self)
```

Additionally, we changed `TodoApp` class to create and hold `Task` instances when the "Add" button is clicked:

```
class TodoApp(ft.Column):    # application's root control is a Column containing all other controls    def __init__(self):        super().__init__()        self.new_task = ft.TextField(hint_text="What needs to be done?", expand=True)        self.tasks = ft.Column()        self.width = 600        self.controls = [            ft.Row(                controls=[                    self.new_task,                    ft.FloatingActionButton(                        icon=ft.Icons.ADD, on_click=self.add_clicked                    ),                ],            ),            self.tasks,        ]    def add_clicked(self, e):        task = Task(self.new_task.value, self.task_delete)        self.tasks.controls.append(task)        self.new_task.value = ""        self.update()    def task_delete(self, task):        self.tasks.controls.remove(task)        self.update()
```

For "Delete" task operation, we implemented `task_delete()` method in `TodoApp` class which accepts task control instance as a parameter.

Then, we passed a reference to `task_delete` method into Task constructor and called it on "Delete" button event handler.

Run the app and try to edit and delete tasks:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-todo/img/docs/tutorial/view-edit-delete.gif)

## Filtering list items[​](/docs/tutorials/python-todo#filtering-list-items "Direct link to Filtering list items")

We already have a functional To-Do app where we can create, edit, and delete tasks. To be even more productive, we want to be able to filter tasks by their status.

Copy the entire code for this step from [here](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/main/python/tutorials/todo/to-do-5.py). Below we will explain the changes we've done to implement filtering.

`Tabs` control is used to display filter:

```
# ...class TodoApp(ft.Column):    # application's root control is a Column containing all other controls    def __init__(self):        super().__init__()        self.new_task = ft.TextField(hint_text="What's needs to be done?", expand=True)        self.tasks = ft.Column()        self.filter = ft.Tabs(            selected_index=0,            on_change=self.tabs_changed,            tabs=[ft.Tab(text="all"), ft.Tab(text="active"), ft.Tab(text="completed")],        )    # ....
```

To display different lists of tasks depending on their statuses, we could maintain three lists with "All", "Active" and "Completed" tasks. We, however, chose an easier approach where we maintain the same list and only change a task's visibility depending on its status.

In `TodoApp` class we overrided [`before_update()`](/docs/getting-started/custom-controls#before_update) method alled every time when the control is being updated. It iterates through all the tasks and updates their `visible` property depending on the status of the task:

```
class TodoApp(ft.Column):    # ...    def before_update(self):        status = self.filter.tabs[self.filter.selected_index].text        for task in self.tasks.controls:            task.visible = (                status == "all"                or (status == "active" and task.completed == False)                or (status == "completed" and task.completed)            )
```

Filtering should occur when we click on a tab or change a task status. `TodoApp.before_update()` method is called when Tabs selected value is changed or Task item checkbox is clicked:

```
class TodoApp(ft.Column):    # ...    def tabs_changed(self, e):        self.update()    def task_status_change(self, e):        self.update()    def add_clicked(self, e):        task = Task(self.new_task.value, self.task_status_change, self.task_delete)    # ...class Task(ft.Column):    def __init__(self, task_name, task_status_change, task_delete):        super().__init__()        self.completed = False        self.task_name = task_name        self.task_status_change = task_status_change        self.task_delete = task_delete        self.display_task = ft.Checkbox(            value=False, label=self.task_name, on_change=self.status_changed        )        # ...    def status_changed(self, e):        self.completed = self.display_task.value        self.task_status_change()
```

Run the app and try filtering tasks by clicking on the tabs:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-todo/img/docs/tutorial/todo-app-filtering.gif)

## Final touches[​](/docs/tutorials/python-todo#final-touches "Direct link to Final touches")

Our Todo app is almost complete now. As a final touch, we will add a footer (`Column` control) displaying the number of incomplete tasks (`Text` control) and a "Clear completed" button.

Copy the entire code for this step from [here](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/main/python/apps/todo/todo.py). Below we highlighted the changes we've done to implement the footer:

```
class TodoApp():    def __init__(self):        # ...        self.items_left = ft.Text("0 items left")        self.width = 600        self.controls = [            ft.Row(                [ft.Text(value="Todos", theme_style=ft.TextThemeStyle.HEADLINE_MEDIUM)],                alignment=ft.MainAxisAlignment.CENTER,            ),            ft.Row(                controls=[                    self.new_task,                    ft.FloatingActionButton(                        icon=ft.Icons.ADD, on_click=self.add_clicked                    ),                ],            ),            ft.Column(                spacing=25,                controls=[                    self.filter,                    self.tasks,                    ft.Row(                        alignment=ft.MainAxisAlignment.SPACE_BETWEEN,                        vertical_alignment=ft.CrossAxisAlignment.CENTER,                        controls=[                            self.items_left,                            ft.OutlinedButton(                                text="Clear completed", on_click=self.clear_clicked                            ),                        ],                    ),                ],            ),        ]    # ...    def clear_clicked(self, e):        for task in self.tasks.controls[:]:            if task.completed:                self.task_delete(task)    def before_update(self):        status = self.filter.tabs[self.filter.selected_index].text        count = 0        for task in self.tasks.controls:            task.visible = (                status == "all"                or (status == "active" and task.completed == False)                or (status == "completed" and task.completed)            )            if not task.completed:                count += 1        self.items_left.value = f"{count} active item(s) left"
```

Run the app:

# Create Calculator app in Python with Flet

In this tutorial we will show you, step-by-step, how to create a Calculator app in Python using Flet framework and publish it as a desktop, mobile or web app. The app is [a simple console program](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/main/python/tutorials/calc/calc.py), yet it is a multi-platform application with similar to iPhone calculator app UI:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-calculator/img/docs/calc-tutorial/calc-app.gif)

You can find the live demo [here](https://gallery.flet.dev/calculator/).

In this tutorial, we will cover all of the basic concepts for creating a Flet app: building a page layout, adding controls, making reusable UI components, handling events, and publishing options.

The tutorial consists of the following steps:

-   [Getting started with Flet](/docs/tutorials/python-calculator#getting-started-with-flet)
-   [Adding page controls](/docs/tutorials/python-calculator#adding-page-controls)
-   [Building page layout](/docs/tutorials/python-calculator#building-page-layout)
-   [Reusable UI components](/docs/tutorials/python-calculator#reusable-ui-components)
-   [Handling events](/docs/tutorials/python-calculator#handling-events)
-   [Publishing your app](/docs/tutorials/python-calculator#publishing-your-app)
-   [Summary](/docs/tutorials/python-calculator#summary)

## Getting started with Flet[​](/docs/tutorials/python-calculator#getting-started-with-flet "Direct link to Getting started with Flet")

To create a multi-platform app in Python with Flet, you don't need to know HTML, CSS or JavaScript, but you do need a basic knowledge of Python and object-oriented programming.

Before you can create your first Flet app, you need to [setup your development environment](/docs/getting-started/), which requires Python 3.9 or above and `flet` package.

Once you have Flet installed, let's [create](/docs/getting-started/create-flet-app) a simple hello-world app.

Create `hello.py` with the following contents:

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    page.add(ft.Text(value="Hello, world!"))ft.app(main)
```

Run this app and you will see a new window with a greeting:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-calculator/img/docs/tutorial/todo-app-hello-world.png)

## Adding page controls[​](/docs/tutorials/python-calculator#adding-page-controls "Direct link to Adding page controls")

Now you are ready to create a calculator app.

To start, you'll need a [Text](/docs/controls/text) control for showing the result of calculation, and a few [ElevatedButtons](/docs/controls/elevatedbutton) with all the numbers and actions on them.

Create `calc.py` with the following contents:

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    page.title = "Calc App"    result = ft.Text(value="0")    page.add(        result,        ft.ElevatedButton(text="AC"),        ft.ElevatedButton(text="+/-"),        ft.ElevatedButton(text="%"),        ft.ElevatedButton(text="/"),        ft.ElevatedButton(text="7"),        ft.ElevatedButton(text="8"),        ft.ElevatedButton(text="9"),        ft.ElevatedButton(text="*"),        ft.ElevatedButton(text="4"),        ft.ElevatedButton(text="5"),        ft.ElevatedButton(text="6"),        ft.ElevatedButton(text="-"),        ft.ElevatedButton(text="1"),        ft.ElevatedButton(text="2"),        ft.ElevatedButton(text="3"),        ft.ElevatedButton(text="+"),        ft.ElevatedButton(text="0"),        ft.ElevatedButton(text="."),        ft.ElevatedButton(text="="),    )ft.app(main)
```

Run the app and you should see a page like this:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-calculator/img/docs/calc-tutorial/calc-app-1.png)

## Building page layout[​](/docs/tutorials/python-calculator#building-page-layout "Direct link to Building page layout")

Now let's arrange the text and buttons in 6 horizontal [rows](/docs/controls/row).

Replace `calc.py` contents with the following:

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    page.title = "Calc App"    result = ft.Text(value="0")    page.add(        ft.Row(controls=[result]),        ft.Row(            controls=[                ft.ElevatedButton(text="AC"),                ft.ElevatedButton(text="+/-"),                ft.ElevatedButton(text="%"),                ft.ElevatedButton(text="/"),            ]        ),        ft.Row(            controls=[                ft.ElevatedButton(text="7"),                ft.ElevatedButton(text="8"),                ft.ElevatedButton(text="9"),                ft.ElevatedButton(text="*"),            ]        ),        ft.Row(            controls=[                ft.ElevatedButton(text="4"),                ft.ElevatedButton(text="5"),                ft.ElevatedButton(text="6"),                ft.ElevatedButton(text="-"),            ]        ),        ft.Row(            controls=[                ft.ElevatedButton(text="1"),                ft.ElevatedButton(text="2"),                ft.ElevatedButton(text="3"),                ft.ElevatedButton(text="+"),            ]        ),        ft.Row(             controls=[                ft.ElevatedButton(text="0"),                ft.ElevatedButton(text="."),                ft.ElevatedButton(text="="),            ]        ),    )ft.app(main)
```

Run the app and you should see a page like this:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-calculator/img/docs/calc-tutorial/calc-app-2.png)

### Using Container for decoration[​](/docs/tutorials/python-calculator#using-container-for-decoration "Direct link to Using Container for decoration")

To add a black background with rounded border around the calculator, we will be using [Container](/docs/controls/container) control. Container may decorate only one control, so we will need to wrap all the 6 rows into a single vertical [Column](/docs/controls/container) that will be used as the container's `content`:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-calculator/img/docs/calc-tutorial/container-layout.svg)

Here is the code for adding the container to the page:

```
    page.add(        ft.Container(            width=350,            bgcolor=ft.Colors.BLACK,            border_radius=ft.border_radius.all(20),            padding=20,            content=ft.Column(                controls=                    [] # Controls will the six rows with the text                        # and the calculator buttons.            )        )    )
```

### Styled Controls[​](/docs/tutorials/python-calculator#styled-controls "Direct link to Styled Controls")

To complete the UI portion of the program, we need to update style for result text and buttons to look similar to iPhone calculator app.

For the result text, let's specify its `color` and `size` properties:

```
result = ft.Text(value="0", color=ft.Colors.WHITE, size=20)
```

For the buttons, if we look again at the UI we are aiming to achieve, there are 3 types of buttons:

1.  **Digit Buttons**. They have dark grey background color and white text, size is the same for all.
2.  **Action Buttons**. They have orange background color and white text, size is the same for all except `0` button which is twice as large.
3.  **Extra action buttons**. They have light grey background color and dark text, size is the same for all.

The buttons will be used multiple time in the program, so we will be creating custom [Styled Controls](/docs/getting-started/custom-controls#styled-controls) to reuse the code.

Since all those types should inherit from `ElevatedButton` class and have common `text` and `expand` properties, let's create a parent `CalcButton` class:

```
    class CalcButton(ft.ElevatedButton):        def __init__(self, text, expand=1):            super().__init__()            self.text = text            self.expand = expand
```

Now let's create child classes for all three types of buttons:

```
    class DigitButton(CalcButton):        def __init__(self, text, expand=1):            CalcButton.__init__(self, text, expand)            self.bgcolor = ft.Colors.WHITE24            self.color = ft.Colors.WHITE    class ActionButton(CalcButton):        def __init__(self, text):            CalcButton.__init__(self, text)            self.bgcolor = ft.Colors.ORANGE            self.color = ft.Colors.WHITE    class ExtraActionButton(CalcButton):        def __init__(self, text):            CalcButton.__init__(self, text)            self.bgcolor = ft.Colors.BLUE_GREY_100            self.color = ft.Colors.BLACK
```

We will be using these new classes now to create rows of buttons in the Container:

```
content=ft.Column(                controls=[                    ft.Row(controls=[result], alignment="end"),                    ft.Row(                        controls=[                            ExtraActionButton(text="AC"),                            ExtraActionButton(text="+/-"),                            ExtraActionButton(text="%"),                            ActionButton(text="/"),                        ]                    ),                    ft.Row(                        controls=[                            DigitButton(text="7"),                            DigitButton(text="8"),                            DigitButton(text="9"),                            ActionButton(text="*"),                        ]                    ),                    ft.Row(                        controls=[                            DigitButton(text="4"),                            DigitButton(text="5"),                            DigitButton(text="6"),                            ActionButton(text="-"),                        ]                    ),                    ft.Row(                        controls=[                            DigitButton(text="1"),                            DigitButton(text="2"),                            DigitButton(text="3"),                            ActionButton(text="+"),                        ]                    ),                    ft.Row(                        controls=[                            DigitButton(text="0", expand=2),                            DigitButton(text="."),                            ActionButton(text="="),                        ]                    ),                ]            ),
```

Since the program is too long now to be fully included in this tutorial, copy the entire code for this step from [here](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/main/python/tutorials/calc/calc3.py). Run the app and you should see a page like this:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-calculator/img/docs/calc-tutorial/calc-app.png)

Just what we wanted!

## Reusable UI components[​](/docs/tutorials/python-calculator#reusable-ui-components "Direct link to Reusable UI components")

While you can continue writing your app in the `main` function, the best practice would be to create a [reusable UI component](/docs/getting-started/custom-controls#composite-controls).

Imagine you are working on an app header, a side menu, or UI that will be a part of a larger project (for example, at Flet we will be using this Calculator app in a bigger "Gallery" app that will show all the examples for Flet framework).

Even if you can't think of such uses right now, we still recommend creating all your Flet apps with composability and reusability in mind.

To make a reusable Calc app component, we are going to encapsulate its state and presentation logic in a separate `CalculatorApp` class. Copy the entire code for this step from [here](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/main/python/tutorials/calc/calc4.py).

Try something

Try adding two `CalculatorApp` components to the page:

```
# create application instancecalc1 = CalculatorApp()calc2 = CalculatorApp()# add application's root control to the pagepage.add(calc1, calc2)
```

## Handling events[​](/docs/tutorials/python-calculator#handling-events "Direct link to Handling events")

Now let's make the calculator do its job. We will be using the same event handler for all the buttons and use `data` property to differentiate between the actions depending on the button clicked. For `CalcButton` class, let's specify `on_click=button_clicked` event and set `data` property equal to button's text:

```
class CalcButton(ft.ElevatedButton):    def __init__(self, text, button_clicked, expand=1):        super().__init__()        self.text = text        self.expand = expand        self.on_click = button_clicked        self.data = text
```

We will define `button_click` method in `CalculatorClass` and pass it to each button. Below is `on_click` event handler that will reset the Text value when "AC" button is clicked:

```
def button_clicked(self, e):    if e.control.data == "AC":        self.result.value = "0"
```

With similar approach, `button_click` method will handle different calculator actions depending on `data` property for each button. Copy the entire code for this step from [here](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/main/python/tutorials/calc/calc.py).

Run the app and see it in the action:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-calculator/img/docs/calc-tutorial/calc-app.gif)

## Publishing your app[​](/docs/tutorials/python-calculator#publishing-your-app "Direct link to Publishing your app")

Congratulations! You have created your Calculator app with Flet, and it looks awesome! Now it's time to share your app with the world!

Flet Python app and all its dependencies can be packaged into a standalone executable a package for distribution using `flet build` command.

[Follow these instructions](/docs/publish) to package your Calculator app into a desktop executable, mobile app bundle or web app.

# Making a Trello clone with Python and Flet

Lets make a clone of Trello in Python with the Flet framework and then deploy it to [fly.io](https://fly.io/)!

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/trello-clone/img/docs/trolli-tutorial/trolli-app.gif)

The code for this tutorial can be found [here](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/tree/main/python/apps/trolli) with self explanatory commits. Be sure to run `pip install -r requirements.txt` after cloning. And [here](https://gallery.flet.dev/trolli/) is a live demo.

## Why Flet?[​](/docs/tutorials/trello-clone#why-flet "Direct link to Why Flet?")

Most developers are undoubtedly familiar with the situation of either having developed a console app that turns out to have a wider audience than originally intended, or needing to develop an internal tool for non-developers but which is destined to have a small user base and/or a relatively brief shelf life. In situations like these it can often feel awkward to reach for an oversized tool such as electron, a feature rich framework like flutter (irony acknowledged!), or try to quickly get a handle on some other cross platform framework like .NET MAUI. What we would really like is to be able to throw a UI on our logic that looks generically decent, has acceptable performance, and ideally, takes less time to write than did the business logic, and preferably in the same language in which the rest of the logic was written - i.e. a language with which we are already proficient (currently the only released library is in Python but C#, Typescript, and Golang libraries are on the roadmap). This is exactly what the Flet platform aims to provide.

Flet takes a different approach to many new UI frameworks that is arguably more intuitive to the majority of experienced programmers. Diverging from the currently ubiquitous declarative approach and opting instead for an imperative model.

Having intimated that Flet is designed with simple GUIs in mind, lets nonetheless try to make something a tad more complicated than, for example, a simple dashboard with some filters, and shoot for something like a minimal version of Trello - and bestow upon it the totally-independently-arrived-at-name, *Trolli*. For the purposes of this tutorial I'll assume the reader is familiar with the basic concept and setup of a Flet project (read [the tutorials](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials) and the [docs](https://flet.dev/docs) if not), and instead focus more on aspects that are not part of the existing tutorials.

## Defining Entities and Layout[​](/docs/tutorials/trello-clone#defining-entities-and-layout "Direct link to Defining Entities and Layout")

With the proximate goal of creating the MVP of our clone, let's start by defining the main entities (`boards`, `board_lists`, `items`), settle on an acceptable design and layout, and implement a sort of pseudo-repository pattern so that in future development we can move from in-memory data storage to persistent storage of some kind.

Here, in the `main.py` module we'll add this code and then continue to define the `TrelloApp` class.

```
import flet as ft if __name__ == "__main__":     def main(page: ft.Page):         page.title = "Flet Trello clone"        page.padding = 0        page.bgcolor = colors.BLUE_GREY_200        app = TrelloApp(page)        page.add(app)        page.update()     ft.app(main)
```

In terms of layout we can consider the app to consist of a header (`appbar`) and below that a collapsible navigation panel, next to which is the active view consisting of either a board, settings, members or whatever else we may choose. Something like this...

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/trello-clone/img/docs/trolli-tutorial/mock-up.png)

So the class for the app itself could look something like this...

```
import flet as ft class TrelloApp:    def __init__(self, page: ft.Page):        self.page = page        self.appbar_items = [            ft.PopupMenuItem(text="Login"),            ft.PopupMenuItem(),  # divider            ft.PopupMenuItem(text="Settings")        ]        self.appbar = ft.AppBar(            leading=ft.Icon(ft.Icons.GRID_GOLDENRATIO_ROUNDED),            leading_width=100,            title=ft.Text("Trolli",size=32, text_align="start"),            center_title=False,            toolbar_height=75,            bgcolor=ft.Colors.LIGHT_BLUE_ACCENT_700,            actions=[                ft.Container(                    content=ft.PopupMenuButton(                        items=self.appbar_items                    ),                    margin=ft.margin.only(left=50, right=25)                )            ],        )        self.page.appbar = self.appbar        self.page.update()
```

In a new file (`app_layout.py`) we can define a layout for our app in a class which will inherit from the `Row` control and in which the navigation rail along with a toggle button to collapse and expand it, and the main content area are laid out. But rather than define the navigation sidebar in that module, we'll place that in its own `sidebar.py` module.

```
import flet as ftfrom sidebar import Sidebarclass AppLayout(ft.Row):    def __init__(self, app, page: ft.Page, *args, **kwargs):        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)        self.app = app        self.page = page        self.toggle_nav_rail_button = ft.IconButton(            icon=ft.Icons.ARROW_CIRCLE_LEFT,            icon_color=ft.Colors.BLUE_GREY_400,            selected=False,            selected_icon=ft.Icons.ARROW_CIRCLE_RIGHT,            on_click=self.toggle_nav_rail,        )        self.sidebar = Sidebar(self, page)        self._active_view: Control = ft.Column(            controls=[ft.Text("Active View")],            alignment=ft.MainAxisAlignmnet.CENTER,            horizontal_alignment=ft.CrossAxisAlignment.CENTER,        )        self.controls = [self.sidebar, self.toggle_nav_rail_button, self.active_view]    @property    def active_view(self):        return self._active_view    @active_view.setter    def active_view(self, view):        self._active_view = view        self.update()    def toggle_nav_rail(self, e):        self.sidebar.visible = not self.sidebar.visible        self.toggle_nav_rail_button.selected = not self.toggle_nav_rail_button.selected        self.page.update()
```

And here is the `Sidebar.py` file.

```
import flet as ftclass Sidebar(ft.Container):    def __init__(self, app_layout, store: DataStore):        self.store: DataStore = store        self.app_layout = app_layout        self.nav_rail_visible = True        self.top_nav_items = [            ft.NavigationRailDestination(                label_content=ft.Text("Boards"),                label="Boards",                icon=ft.Icons.BOOK_OUTLINED,                selected_icon=ft.Icons.BOOK_OUTLINED,            ),            ft.NavigationRailDestination(                label_content=ft.Text("Members"),                label="Members",                icon=ft.Icons.PERSON,                selected_icon=ft.Icons.PERSON,            ),        ]        self.top_nav_rail = ft.NavigationRail(            selected_index=None,            label_type=ft.NavigationRailLabelType.ALL,            on_change=self.top_nav_change,            destinations=self.top_nav_items,            bgcolor=ft.Colors.BLUE_GREY,            extended=True,            height=110,        )        self.toggle_nav_rail_button = ft.IconButton(ft.Icons.ARROW_BACK)        super().__init__(            content=ft.Column(                [                    ft.Row(                        [                            ft.Text("Workspace"),                        ],                        alignment=ft.MainAxisAlignment.SPACE_BETWEEN,                    ),                    # divider                    ft.Container(                        bgcolor=ft.Colors.BLACK26,                        border_radius=ft.border_radius.all(30),                        height=1,                        alignment=ft.alignment.center_right,                        width=220,                    ),                    self.top_nav_rail,                    # divider                    ft.Container(                        bgcolor=ft.Colors.BLACK26,                        border_radius=ft.border_radius.all(30),                        height=1,                        alignment=ft.alignment.center_right,                        width=220,                    ),                ],                tight=True,            ),            padding=ft.padding.all(15),            margin=ft.margin.all(0),            width=250,            bgcolor=ft.Colors.BLUE_GREY,            visible=self.nav_rail_visible,        )    def top_nav_change(self, e):        self.top_nav_rail.selected_index = e.control.selected_index        self.update()
```

If we run the main app with

```
flet run
```

we can see the result and get hot reloading when we make any style changes. For example, try adding `alignment=ft.MainAxisAlignment.CENTER` to the first row in the container like this…

```
content = ft.Column(    ft.Row([ft.Text("Workspace")], alignment=ft.MainAxisAlignment.CENTER))
```

If you save the file you should be able to see the change in your app window.

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/trello-clone/img/docs/trolli-tutorial/basic-nav-rail-toggle.gif)

Before we move on let's define our basic entities. We'll need a `Board` class, which will keep a list of lists, each of which will be a `BoardList` object (apologies for the unfortunate lexical collisions here - the colloquial use of 'list' derives from the nature of the app, whereas the technical use of 'list' derives from python's particular term for an array-like data structure), and each of which, in turn, will contain a list of `Item` objects. If that's confusing, take some time to look over the source code to clear things up.

For each of the entities, we'll add an application wide unique id with an `id_counter = itertools.count()` statement at the top of each class and a call to `next(Board.id_counter)` at initialization. This way two lists or boards can have the same name but still represent distinct entities.

## Data Access Layer and Customization[​](/docs/tutorials/trello-clone#data-access-layer-and-customization "Direct link to Data Access Layer and Customization")

Now that we have a basic layout and entities defined, let's add a few customization parameters to the app itself. Lets also take some time to create a basic data access interface. You can see the boiler plate for the interface and the in-memory implementation in the `data_store.py` and `memory_store.py` files respectively. This will make it easier for us to swap in some persistent storage solution in a future tutorial.

Here is the updated main function. We need to instantiate the `InMemoryStore` class within the main method so that each user session (i.e. each new tab using the app), has it's own version of the store. We'll then need to pass that store to each of the components that will need access to it.

We'll also add a new font in an *assets* directory, which is specified in the named argument to the app function.

```
if __name__ == "__main__":    def main(page: ft.Page):        page.title = "Flet Trello clone"        page.padding = 0        page.theme = ft.Theme(font_family="Verdana")        page.theme_mode = ft.ThemeMode.LIGHT        page.theme.page_transitions.windows = "cupertino"        page.fonts = {"Pacifico": "/Pacifico-Regular.ttf"}        page.bgcolor = ft.Colors.BLUE_GREY_200        page.update()        app = TrelloApp(page)    ft.app(main, assets_dir="../assets")
```

## Application Logic[​](/docs/tutorials/trello-clone#application-logic "Direct link to Application Logic")

You can run the app now but apart from a nicer font for the name, it still does not have any functionality. Now it's time to fill out the application logic. Although this app might qualify as non-trivial, we won't bother to separate the code into distinct application and business layers. The separation of the data access and the rest of the logic will suffice for this non-architecturally focused tutorial, though further separation may be a sensible thing to consider.

### Creating Views[​](/docs/tutorials/trello-clone#creating-views "Direct link to Creating Views")

First up, we will add views to correspond to the sidebar navigation destinations. We need a view to display all boards and a view to display a Members pane which, for now, will simply be a placeholder until a future tutorial. We'll add these views as controls to the `app_layout.py` module.

```
self.members_view = ft.Text("members view")self.all_boards_view = ft.Column(    [        ft.Row(            [                ft.Container(                    ft.Text(                        value="Your Boards",                        theme_style=ft.TextThemeStyle.HEADLINE_MEDIUM,                    ),                    expand=True,                    padding=ft.padding.only(top=15),                ),                ft.Container(                    ft.TextButton(                        "Add new board",                        icon=ft.Icons.ADD,                        on_click=self.app.add_board,                        style=ft.ButtonStyle(                            bgcolor={                                ft.ControlState.DEFAULT: ft.Colors.BLUE_200,                                ft.ControlState.HOVERED: ft.Colors.BLUE_400,                            },                            shape={                                ft.ControlState.DEFAULT: ft.RoundedRectangleBorder(                                    radius=3                                )                            },                        ),                    ),                    padding=ft.padding.only(right=50, top=15),                ),            ]        ),        ft.Row(            [                ft.TextField(                    hint_text="Search all boards",                    autofocus=False,                    content_padding=ft.padding.only(left=10),                    width=200,                    height=40,                    text_size=12,                    border_color=ft.Colors.BLACK26,                    focused_border_color=ft.Colors.BLUE_ACCENT,                    suffix_icon=ft.Icons.SEARCH,                )            ]        ),        ft.Row([ft.Text("No Boards to Display")]),    ],    expand=True,)
```

Since we are working in an imperative paradigm and have no explicit state management tool such as redux or the like, we will need a method to 'rehydrate' the view that shows all the boards so that its current state reflects changes made in other entities (namely the sideboard).

```
def hydrate_all_boards_view(self):    self.all_boards_view.controls[-1] = ft.Row(        [            ft.Container(                content=ft.Row(                    [                        ft.Container(                            content=ft.Text(value=b.name),                            data=b,                            expand=True,                            on_click=self.board_click,                        ),                        ft.Container(                            content=ft.PopupMenuButton(                                items=[                                    ft.PopupMenuItem(                                        content=ft.Text(                                            value="Delete",                                            theme_style=ft.TextThemeStyle.LABEL_MEDIUM,                                            text_align=ft.TextAlign.CENTER,                                        ),                                        on_click=self.app.delete_board,                                        data=b,                                    ),                                    ft.PopupMenuItem(),                                    ft.PopupMenuItem(                                        content=ft.Text(                                            value="Archive",                                            theme_style=ft.TextThemeStyle.LABEL_MEDIUM,                                            text_align=ft.TextAlign.CENTER,                                        ),                                    ),                                ]                            ),                            padding=ft.padding.only(right=-10),                            border_radius=ft.border_radius.all(3),                        ),                    ],                    alignment=ft.MainAxisAlignment.SPACE_BETWEEN,                ),                border=ft.border.all(1, ft.Colors.BLACK38),                border_radius=ft.border_radius.all(5),                bgcolor=ft.Colors.WHITE60,                padding=ft.padding.all(10),                width=250,                data=b,            )            for b in self.store.get_boards()        ],        wrap=True,    )    self.sidebar.sync_board_destinations()
```

### Syncing Navigation Panel[​](/docs/tutorials/trello-clone#syncing-navigation-panel "Direct link to Syncing Navigation Panel")

Next up we need a visually distinct section of the navigation panel to display boards we've created. We'll add a second, `bottom_nav_rail` to the sidebar to represent when a particular board is the active view. This will necessitate a `sync_board_destinations` method in the sidebar component to be called whenever any change has been made to the list of current boards. We'll now have a change handler for each of the top and bottom nav rails.

```
self.top_nav_rail = ft.NavigationRail(    selected_index=None,    label_type=ft.NavigationRailLabelType.ALL,    on_change=self.top_nav_change,    destinations=self.top_nav_items,    bgcolor=ft.Colors.BLUE_GREY,    extended=True,    height=110,)self.bottom_nav_rail = ft.NavigationRail(    selected_index=None,    label_type=ft.NavigationRailLabelType.ALL,    on_change=self.bottom_nav_change,    extended=True,    expand=True,    bgcolor=ft.Colors.BLUE_GREY,)...def sync_board_destinations(self):    boards = self.store.get_boards()    self.bottom_nav_rail.destinations = []    for i in range(len(boards)):        b = boards[i]        self.bottom_nav_rail.destinations.append(            ft.NavigationRailDestination(                label_content=ft.TextField(                    value=b.name,                    hint_text=b.name,                    text_size=12,                    read_only=True,                    on_focus=self.board_name_focus,                    on_blur=self.board_name_blur,                    border=ft.InputBorder.NONE,                    height=50,                    width=150,                    text_align=ft.TextAlign.START,                    data=i,                ),                label=b.name,                selected_icon=ft.Icons.CHEVRON_RIGHT_ROUNDED,                icon=ft.Icons.CHEVRON_RIGHT_OUTLINED,            )        )      
```

Now we can add new boards and they appear in our navigation rail. Unfortunately clicking on the navigation rail doesn't actually navigate to anything.

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/trello-clone/img/docs/trolli-tutorial/add-board-capability.gif)

There are several ways we could achieve this such as having every view present in the `app_layout.py` module and then toggling visibility on/off of the relevant views depending on the navigation rail index. But that wouldn't help much in a browser context, nor in a mobile context with a back button. We'll need to consider routing. Flet provides a `TemplateRoute` utility class for url matching.

### Routing[​](/docs/tutorials/trello-clone#routing "Direct link to Routing")

In the `main.py` module let's wire up a handler to the `page.on_route_change` event.

```
class TrelloApp(AppLayout):    def __init__(self, page: ft.Page, user=None):        ...        self.page.on_route_change = self.route_change        ...    def initialize(self):        self.page.views.append(            ft.View(                "/",                [self.appbar, self],                padding=ft.padding.all(0),                bgcolor=ft.Colors.BLUE_GREY_200,            )        )        self.page.update()        # create an initial board for demonstration if no boards        if len(self.boards) == 0:            self.create_new_board("My First Board")        self.page.go("/")    def route_change(self, e):        troute = ft.TemplateRoute(self.page.route)        if troute.match("/"):            self.page.go("/boards")        elif troute.match("/board/:id"):            if int(troute.id) > len(self.store.get_boards()):                self.page.go("/")                return            self.set_board_view(int(troute.id))        elif troute.match("/boards"):            self.set_all_boards_view()        elif troute.match("/members"):            self.set_members_view()        self.page.update()
```

While here, we'll also change our initialization method so that the app starts with a pre-made board for demonstration purposes. Within that method note that we add a flet `View` object to the page. The page maintains a list of Views as top level containers for other Controls in order to track navigation history. We'll need to add the corresponding `set_***_view` methods to the `layout.py` module as well. Here is the `set_board_view` method for example...

```
def set_board_view(self, i):    self.active_view = self.store.get_boards()[i]    self.sidebar.bottom_nav_rail.selected_index = i    self.sidebar.top_nav_rail.selected_index = None    self.page.update()
```

Now, if we fire up the project in a web browser with the

```
flet run -dw
```

command (*\-d* flag for hot reloading, and *\-w* flag for web) we can add some boards and reach them by clicking or entering `board/{i}`, where *i* is the zero indexed board, as the url.

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/trello-clone/img/docs/trolli-tutorial/navigation.gif)

### Changing Board Names[​](/docs/tutorials/trello-clone#changing-board-names "Direct link to Changing Board Names")

Next, we should include the ability to change the name of a board. In contrast to the more "*proper*" title editing logic that was implemented in the `board_list.py` module I'm going to favor what some might consider a more "*hacky*" approach because I personally dislike overly ceremonial editing flows, particularly in such a low stakes, fluid sort of application. We'll make use of the `on_focus` and `on_blur` events in the bottom navigation rail destinations in the `sidebar.py` module. Here are the handlers we'll add.

```
def board_name_focus(self, e):    e.control.read_only = False    e.control.border = ft.InputBorder.OUTLINE    self.page.update()def board_name_blur(self, e):    self.store.update_board(        self.store.get_boards()[e.control.data], {"name": e.control.value}    )    self.app_layout.hydrate_all_boards_view()    e.control.read_only = True    e.control.border = ft.InputBorder.NONE    self.page.update()
```

This makes for a very intuitive way to change a board name without unnecessary dialogs or extraneous button presses.

Let's also quickly stub a login procedure which will be more fully realized in a future instalment. For now, we'll simply add the following login method and wire it up to the login `PopupMenuItem` on\_click event.

```
def login(self, e):    def close_dlg(e):        if user_name.value == "" or password.value == "":            user_name.error_text = "Please provide username"            password.error_text = "Please provide password"            self.page.update()            return        else:            user = User(user_name.value, password.value)            if user not in self.store.get_users():                self.store.add_user(user)            self.user = user_name.value            self.page.client_storage.set("current_user", user_name.value)        self.page.close(dialog)        self.appbar_items[0] = ft.PopupMenuItem(            text=f"{self.page.client_storage.get('current_user')}'s Profile"        )        self.page.update()    user_name = ft.TextField(label="User name")    password = ft.TextField(label="Password", password=True)    dialog = ft.AlertDialog(        title=ft.Text("Please enter your login credentials"),        content=ft.Column(            [                user_name,                password,                ft.ElevatedButton(text="Login", on_click=close_dlg),            ],            tight=True,        ),        on_dismiss=lambda e: print("Modal dialog dismissed!"),    )    self.page.open(dialog)
```

## Drag and Drop[​](/docs/tutorials/trello-clone#drag-and-drop "Direct link to Drag and Drop")

Next, we'll add crucial drag and drop functionality to lists themselves and items within lists.

We'll start with the simpler case of re-ordering lists within boards. In order to give some visual indication of the target to which we're dragging a list, we'll modify the `board_list` containers `border` property, darkening the color on the `list_will_drag_accept` event handler, and returning it to a lighter color in the `list_drag_accept` and `list_drag_leave` handlers.

Next, we'll wrap the `board_list` view in a `DragTarget` object, all of which we will then wrap in a `Draggable` object. Both of these will be passed a `group` parameter of "lists". This will be important since later we will want to add the ability to drag and drop individual items between different lists so for that function we'll specify a different group. If anything is unclear in the previous sentence. , have a look at the relevant [documentation](https://flet.dev/docs/controls/draggable).

Now the composition of the view should look something like this.

```
self.view = ft.DragTarget(    group="items",    content=ft.Draggable(        group="lists",        content=ft.DragTarget(            group="lists",            content=self.inner_list,            data=self,            on_accept=self.list_drag_accept,            on_will_accept=self.list_will_drag_accept,            on_leave=self.list_drag_leave,        ),    ),    data=self,    on_accept=self.item_drag_accept,    on_will_accept=self.item_will_drag_accept,    on_leave=self.item_drag_leave,)self.inner_list = ft.Container(    content=ft.Column(        [            self.header,            self.new_item_field,            ft.TextButton(                content=ft.Row(                    [                        ft.Icon(ft.Icons.ADD),                        ft.Text("add card", color=ft.Colors.BLACK38),                    ],                    tight=True,                ),                on_click=self.add_item_handler,            ),            self.items,            self.end_indicator,        ],        spacing=4,        tight=True,        data=self.title,    ),    width=250,    border=ft.border.all(2, ft.Colors.BLACK12),    border_radius=ft.border_radius.all(5),    bgcolor=self.color if (self.color != "") else ft.Colors.BACKGROUND,    padding=ft.padding.only(bottom=10, right=10, left=10, top=5),)
```

with the event handlers defined thus.

```
def list_drag_accept(self, e):    src = self.page.get_control(e.src_id)    l = self.board.content.controls    to_index = l.index(e.control.data)    from_index = l.index(src.content.data)    l[to_index], l[from_index] = l[from_index], l[to_index]    self.inner_list.border = ft.border.all(2, ft.Colors.BLACK12)    self.page.update()def list_will_drag_accept(self, e):    if e.data == "true":        self.inner_list.border = ft.border.all(2, ft.Colors.BLACK)    self.update()def list_drag_leave(self, e):    self.inner_list.border = ft.border.all(2, ft.Colors.BLACK12)    self.update()
```

Note the manipulation of the opacity field acting as a visual indication that the dragged item will be accepted on the target.

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/trello-clone/img/docs/trolli-tutorial/drag-drop-list.gif)

Now for the slightly more complex case of dragging items within a list (including potentially to another list on the same board). Now that we want a `board_list` to not only be a drag target for other lists, but also for items being dragged to it from a different list, we'll need to add another `DragTarget` wrapper to the list, but this time we'll assign the group name "items" so that it only responds to the dragging of items.

Since we'll have the ability to drag the list to a location above or below an existing list we'll employ a different visual indicator strategy to what we've implemented for list dragging. We'll make sure that every time a new `item` is added to the `board_list` it will be interspersed with a visual indicator (implemented as a simple Container object).

The `item.py` module will now need its view wrapped by `Draggable` and `DragTarget` and assigned to the "items" group as seen below together with event handlers.

```
self.view = ft.Draggable(    group="items",    content=ft.DragTarget(        group="items",        content=self.card_item,        on_accept=self.drag_accept,        on_leave=self.drag_leave,        on_will_accept=self.drag_will_accept,    ),    data=self,)self.card_item = ft.Card(    content=ft.Row(        [            ft.Container(                content=ft.Checkbox(label=f"{self.item_text}", width=200),                border_radius=ft.border_radius.all(5),            )        ],        width=200,        wrap=True,    ),    elevation=1,    data=self.list,)def drag_accept(self, e):    src = self.page.get_control(e.src_id)    # skip if item is dropped on itself    if src.content.content == e.control.content:        self.card_item.elevation = 1        self.list.set_indicator_opacity(self, 0.0)        e.control.update()        return    # item dropped within same list but not on self    if src.data.list == self.list:        self.list.add_item(chosen_control=src.data, swap_control=self)        self.card_item.elevation = 1        e.control.update()        return    # item added to different list    self.list.add_item(src.data.item_text, swap_control=self)    # remove from the list to which draggable belongs    src.data.list.remove_item(src.data)    self.list.set_indicator_opacity(self, 0.0)    self.card_item.elevation = 1    self.page.update()def drag_will_accept(self, e):    if e.data == "true":        self.list.set_indicator_opacity(self, 1.0)    self.card_item.elevation = 20 if e.data == "true" else 1    self.page.update()def drag_leave(self, e):    self.list.set_indicator_opacity(self, 0.0)    self.card_item.elevation = 1    self.page.update()
```

We need somewhere to house the logic that will decide on how and when to modify the items owned by a `board_list` object based on a drag event. There are surely design pattern militants out there that will find several dozen unholy violations of the sacred order of clean software design in the following approach but for this size of application, simply overloading the `add_item` method to take optional keyword args when called from different places, as seen below, seems to me like a perfectly workable approach.

```
def add_item(    self,    item: str | None = None,    chosen_control: ft.Draggable | None = None,    swap_control: ft.Draggable | None = None,):    controls_list = [x.controls[1] for x in self.items.controls]    to_index = (        controls_list.index(swap_control) if swap_control in controls_list else None    )    from_index = (        controls_list.index(chosen_control) if chosen_control in controls_list else None    )    control_to_add = ft.Column(        [            ft.Container(                bgcolor=ft.Colors.BLACK26,                border_radius=ft.border_radius.all(30),                height=3,                alignment=ft.alignment.center_right,                width=200,                opacity=0.0,            )        ]    )    # rearrange (i.e. drag drop from same list)    if (from_index is not None) and (to_index is not None):        self.items.controls.insert(to_index, self.items.controls.pop(from_index))        self.set_indicator_opacity(swap_control, 0.0)    # insert (drag from other list to middle of this list)    elif to_index is not None:        new_item = Item(self, self.store, item)        control_to_add.controls.append(new_item)        self.items.controls.insert(to_index, control_to_add)    # add new (drag from other list to end of this list, or use add item button)    else:        new_item = (            Item(self, self.store, item)            if item            else Item(self, self.store, self.new_item_field.value)        )        control_to_add.controls.append(new_item)        self.items.controls.append(control_to_add)        self.store.add_item(self.board_list_id, new_item)        self.new_item_field.value = ""    self.page.update()
```

And with these changes, we should be able to drag lists around within the board and also drag items between different lists.

## Handling Page Resizing[​](/docs/tutorials/trello-clone#handling-page-resizing "Direct link to Handling Page Resizing")

The only final bit of logic we need to add is some page resizing to ensure that if more lists exist than can be displayed, there is a scroll bar to reach them. This logic will also have to take into account the state of the sidebar - extended or not.

We'll add a resize method to `board.py` module.

```
def resize(self, nav_rail_extended, width, height):    self.board_lists.width = (width - 310) if nav_rail_extended else (width - 50)    self.height = height    self.update()
```

and wire up this `page.on_resize` handler in the `app_layout.py` module.

```
def page_resize(self, e=None):    if type(self.active_view) is Board:        self.active_view.resize(self.sidebar.visible, self.page.width, self.page.height)    self.page.update()
```

## Deploying as Web App[​](/docs/tutorials/trello-clone#deploying-as-web-app "Direct link to Deploying as Web App")

When you execute `flet run` the Flet web server a.k.a *Fletd* is started in order to send updates to the Flutter based UI. The communication between both the server and the UI, and the server and your client code, happens in WebSockets. Therefore, you should make sure that wherever you deploy your app there is sufficient WebSockets support. For this tutorial, we'll deploy to [fly.io](https://fly.io/), which offers up to 3 VMs and 3GB storage on its free tier. If you are more accustomed to AWS services (or someone else is paying 😄), you could consider adapting this deployment strategy to Fargate.

Once you have [installed the flyctl command line utility](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/), and created an account you can authenticate by running

```
fly auth login
```

[fly.io](https://fly.io/) works by creating micro-VMs based on a Docker container. As such, you'll need a `DockerFile` in the root of your repository, and you'll also need a `fly.toml` configuration file. The latter can also be created by running

```
fly launch
```

in your repository and following the prompts. If need be you can refer to the named commits in the companion repo for this tutorial.

Once you've verified that your docker image can be built and run locally, you can create your app by running

```
fly apps create --name <app-name>
```

and then deploy with

```
fly deploy 
```

If the deployment is successful you should be able to visit the app by running

```
fly apps open
```

## Summary[​](/docs/tutorials/trello-clone#summary "Direct link to Summary")

Hopefully this walkthrough gives the reader some idea of how actual usable apps can be developed and deployed using the Flet framework. The flexibility, speed of development and developer experience make it a really compelling tool to reach for in many different use cases and there is an ever growing number of devs doing just that.

# Creating Solitaire game with Python and Flet - Part 1

In this tutorial we will show you step-by-step creation of a famous Klondike solitaire game in Python with Flet. For an inspiration, we looked at this online game: [https://www.solitr.com/](https://www.solitr.com/)

This tutorial is aimed at beginner/intermediate level Python developers who have basic knowledge of Python and object oriented programming.

Here you can see the final result that you are going to achieve with Flet and this tutorial: [https://gallery.flet.dev/solitaire/](https://gallery.flet.dev/solitaire/)

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire/img/docs/solitaire-tutorial/part1_final.gif)

We have broken down the game implementation into the following steps:

-   [Winning the game](/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire#winning-the-game)
-   [Deploying the app](/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire#deploying-the-app)

In the Part 2 (will be covered in the next tutorial) we'll be adding Appbar with options to start new game, view game rules and change game settings.

## Getting started with Flet[​](/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire#getting-started-with-flet "Direct link to Getting started with Flet")

To create a multi-platform app in Python with Flet, you don't need to know HTML, CSS or JavaScript, but you do need a basic knowledge of Python and object-oriented programming.

Before you can create your first Flet app, you need to [setup your development environment](/docs/getting-started/), which requires Python 3.9 or above and `flet` package.

Once you have Flet installed, let's [create](/docs/getting-started/create-flet-app) a simple hello-world app.

Create `hello.py` with the following contents:

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    page.add(ft.Text(value="Hello, world!"))ft.app(main)
```

Run this app and you will see a new window with a greeting:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire/img/docs/tutorial/todo-app-hello-world.png)

## Proof of concept app for draggable cards[​](/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire#proof-of-concept-app-for-draggable-cards "Direct link to Proof of concept app for draggable cards")

For the proof of concept, we will only be using three types of controls:

-   [Stack](/docs/controls/stack) - will be used as a parent control for absolute positioning of slots and cards
-   [GestureDetector](/docs/controls/gesturedetector) - the card that will be moved within the Stack
-   [Container](/docs/controls/container) - the slot where the card will be dropped. Also will be used as `content` for the GestureDetector.

We have broken down the proof of concept app into four easy steps, so that after each step you have a complete short program to run and test.

### Step 1: Drag the card around[​](/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire#step-1-drag-the-card-around "Direct link to Step 1: Drag the card around")

In this step we will create a `Stack` (Solitaire game field) and a `GestureDetector` (Solitaire card). The card will then be added to the list of the Stack `controls`. `Top` and `left` properties of the GestureDetector are used for absolute positioning of the card in the Stack.

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    card = ft.GestureDetector(       left=0,       top=0,       content=ft.Container(bgcolor=ft.Colors.GREEN, width=70, height=100),   )       page.add(ft.Stack(controls=[card], width=1000, height=500)) ft.app(main)
```

Run the app to see the the card added to the stack:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire/img/docs/solitaire-tutorial/drag_and_drop1.png)

To be able to move the card, we'll create a `drag` method that will be called in `on_pan_update` event of GestureDetector which happens every `drag_interval` while the user drags the card with their mouse.

To show the card's movement, we’ll be updating the card’s `top` and `left` properties in the `drag` method each time the `on_pan_update` event happens.

Below is the simplest code for dragging GestureDetector in Stack:

```
import flet as ft # Use of GestureDetector for with on_pan_update event for dragging card# Absolute positioning of controls within stack def main(page: ft.Page):    def drag(e: ft.DragUpdateEvent):       e.control.top = max(0, e.control.top + e.delta_y)       e.control.left = max(0, e.control.left + e.delta_x)       e.control.update()    card = ft.GestureDetector(       mouse_cursor=ft.MouseCursor.MOVE,       drag_interval=5,       on_pan_update=drag,       left=0,       top=0,       content=ft.Container(bgcolor=ft.Colors.GREEN, width=70, height=100),   )       page.add(ft.Stack(controls=[card], width=1000, height=500)) ft.app(main)
```

Now you can see the card moving:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire/img/docs/solitaire-tutorial/drag_and_drop2.gif)

note

After any properties of a control are updated, an `update()` method of the control (or its parent control) should be called for the update to take effect.

### Step 2: Drop the card in the slot or bounce it back[​](/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire#step-2-drop-the-card-in-the-slot-or-bounce-it-back "Direct link to Step 2: Drop the card in the slot or bounce it back")

The goal of this step is to be able to drop a card into a slot if it is close enough and bounce it back if it’s not.

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire/img/docs/solitaire-tutorial/drag_and_drop3.gif)

Let’s create a `Container` control that will represent a slot to which we’ll be dropping the card:

```
slot = ft.Container(    width=70, height=100, left=200, top=0, border=ft.border.all(1)    )page.add(ft.Stack(controls = [slot, card], width=1000, height=500))
```

`on_pan_end` event of the card is called when the card is dropped:

```
card = ft.GestureDetector(    mouse_cursor=ft.MouseCursor.MOVE,    drag_interval=5,    on_pan_update=drag,    on_pan_end=drop,    left=0,    top=0,    content=ft.Container(bgcolor=ft.Colors.GREEN, width=70, height=100),)
```

On this event, we’ll call `drop` method to check if the card is close enough to the slot (let’s say it’s closer than 20px to the slot), and `place` it there:

```
def drop(e: ft.DragEndEvent):    if (        abs(e.control.top - slot.top) < 20        and abs(e.control.left - slot.left) < 20    ):        place(e.control, slot)    e.control.update()def place(card, slot):    """place card to the slot"""    card.top = slot.top    card.left = slot.left    page.update()
```

Now, if the card is not close enough, we need to bounce it back to its original position. Unfortunately, we don’t know the original position coordinates, since the card’s `top` and `left` properties were changed on `on_pan_update` event.

To solve this problem, let’s create a `Solitaire` class object to keep track of the original position of the card when `on_pan_start` event of the card is called:

```
class Solitaire:   def __init__(self):       self.start_top = 0       self.start_left = 0solitaire = Solitaire()def start_drag(e: ft.DragStartEvent):    solitaire.start_top = e.control.top    solitaire.start_left = e.control.left    e.control.update()
```

Now let’s update `on_pan_end` event with the option to bounce card back:

```
def bounce_back(game, card):    """return card to its original position"""    card.top = game.start_top    card.left = game.start_left    page.update()def drop(e: ft.DragEndEvent):    if (        abs(e.control.top - slot.top) < 20        and abs(e.control.left - slot.left) < 20    ):        place(e.control, slot)    else:        bounce_back(solitaire, e.control)    e.control.update()
```

The full code for this step can be found [here](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/main/python/tutorials/solitaire/solitaire-drag-and-drop/step2.py).

### Step 3: Adding a second card[​](/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire#step-3-adding-a-second-card "Direct link to Step 3: Adding a second card")

Eventually, we’ll need 52 cards to play the game. For our proof of concept, let’s add a second card:

```
   card2 = ft.GestureDetector(       mouse_cursor=ft.MouseCursor.MOVE,       drag_interval=5,       on_pan_start=start_drag,       on_pan_update=drag,       on_pan_end=drop,       left=100,       top=0,       content=ft.Container(bgcolor=ft.Colors.YELLOW, width=70, height=100),   )   controls = [slot, card1, card2]   page.add(ft.Stack(controls=controls, width=1000, height=500))
```

Now, if you run the app with the two cards, you will notice that when you move the cards around, the yellow card (card2) is moving as expected but the green the card (card1) is moving under the yellow card.

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire/img/docs/solitaire-tutorial/drag_and_drop4.gif)

It happens because card2 is added to the list of stack `controls` after card1. To fix this problem, we need to move the draggable card to the top of the list of controls on `on_pan_start` event:

```
def move_on_top(card, controls):    """Moves draggable card to the top of the stack"""    controls.remove(card)    controls.append(card)    page.update()def start_drag(e: ft.DragStartEvent):    move_on_top(e.control, controls)    solitaire.start_top = e.control.top    solitaire.start_left = e.control.left
```

Now the two cards can be dragged without issues:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire/img/docs/solitaire-tutorial/drag_and_drop5.gif)

The full code for this step can be found [here](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/main/python/tutorials/solitaire/solitaire-drag-and-drop/step3.py).

### Step 4: Adding more slots[​](/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire#step-4-adding-more-slots "Direct link to Step 4: Adding more slots")

As a final step for the proof of concept app, let’s create two more slots:

```
slot0 = ft.Container(    width=70, height=100, left=0, top=0, border=ft.border.all(1))slot1 = ft.Container(    width=70, height=100, left=200, top=0, border=ft.border.all(1))slot2 = ft.Container(    width=70, height=100, left=300, top=0, border=ft.border.all(1))slots = [slot0, slot1, slot2]
```

When creating new cards, we’ll will not specify their `top` and `left` position now, but instead, will place them to the `slot0`:

```
# deal cardsplace(card1, slot0)place(card2, slot0)
```

`on_pan_end` event, where we check if a card is close to a slot, we will now go through the list of slots to find where the card should be dropped:

```
def drop(e: ft.DragEndEvent):    for slot in slots:        if (            abs(e.control.top - slot.top) < 20        and abs(e.control.left - slot.left) < 20        ):            place(e.control, slot)            e.control.update()            return            bounce_back(solitaire, e.control)    e.control.update()
```

As a result, the two cards can be dragged between the three slots:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire/img/docs/solitaire-tutorial/drag_and_drop6.gif)

The full code for this step can be found [here](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/main/python/tutorials/solitaire/solitaire-drag-and-drop/step4.py).

Congratulations on completing the proof of concept app for the Solitaire game! Now you can work with `GestureDetector` to move cards inside `Stack` and place them to certain `Containers`, which is a great part of the game to begin with.

## Fanned card piles[​](/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire#fanned-card-piles "Direct link to Fanned card piles")

In the proof of concept app you have accomplished the task of dropping a card into a slot in proximity or bounce it back. If there is already a card in that slot, the new card is placed on top of it, covering it completely.

In the actual Solitaire game, if there is already a card in a *tableau* slot, you want to place the draggable card a bit lower, so that you can see the previous card too, and if there are two cards, even lower. Those are called “fanned piles”.

Then, we want to be able to pick a card from the fanned pile that is not the top card of the pile and drag the card together with all the cards below it:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire/img/docs/solitaire-tutorial/fanned_piles3.gif)

To be able to do that, it would be useful to have the information about the pile of cards in the slot from which the card is dragged, as well as in the slot to which it is being dropped. Let’s restructure our program and get it ready for the implementation of the fanned piles.

### Slot, Card and Solitaire classes[​](/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire#slot-card-and-solitaire-classes "Direct link to Slot, Card and Solitaire classes")

A slot could have a `pile` property that would hold a list of cards that were placed there. Now the slot is a `Container` control object, and we can’t add any new properties to it. Let’s create a new `Slot` class that will inherit from `Container` and add a `pile` property to it:

```
SLOT_WIDTH = 70SLOT_HEIGHT = 100 import flet as ft class Slot(ft.Container):   def __init__(self, top, left):       super().__init__()       self.pile=[]       self.width=SLOT_WIDTH       self.height=SLOT_HEIGHT       self.left=left       self.top=top       self.border=ft.border.all(1)
```

Similarly to `Slot` class, let’s create a new `Card` class with `slot` property to remember in which slot it resides. It will inherit from `GestureDetector` and we’ll move all card-related methods to it:

```
CARD_WIDTH = 70CARD_HEIGTH = 100DROP_PROXIMITY = 20 import flet as ft class Card(ft.GestureDetector):   def __init__(self, solitaire, color):       super().__init__()       self.slot = None       self.mouse_cursor=ft.MouseCursor.MOVE       self.drag_interval=5       self.on_pan_start=self.start_drag       self.on_pan_update=self.drag       self.on_pan_end=self.drop       self.left=None       self.top=None       self.solitaire = solitaire       self.color = color       self.content=ft.Container(bgcolor=self.color, width=CARD_WIDTH, height=CARD_HEIGTH)      def move_on_top(self):       """Moves draggable card to the top of the stack"""       self.solitaire.controls.remove(self)       self.solitaire.controls.append(self)       self.solitaire.update()    def bounce_back(self):       """Returns card to its original position"""       self.top = self.slot.top       self.left = self.slot.left       self.update()    def place(self, slot):       """Place card to the slot"""       self.top = slot.top       self.left = slot.left    def start_drag(self, e: ft.DragStartEvent):       self.move_on_top()       self.update()    def drag(self, e: ft.DragUpdateEvent):       self.top = max(0, self.top + e.delta_y)       self.left = max(0, self.left + e.delta_x)       self.update()    def drop(self, e: ft.DragEndEvent):       for slot in self.solitaire.slots:           if (               abs(self.top - slot.top) < DROP_PROXIMITY           and abs(self.left - slot.left) < DROP_PROXIMITY         ):               self.place(slot)               self.update()               return                self.bounce_back()       self.update()
```

note

Note: since each card has `slot` property now, there is no need to remember `start_left` and `start_top` position of the draggable card in Solitaire class anymore, because we can just bounce it back to it’s slot.

Let’s update `Solitaire` class to inherit from `Stack`, and move the creation of cards and slots there:

```
SOLITAIRE_WIDTH = 1000SOLITAIRE_HEIGHT = 500 import flet as ftfrom slot import Slotfrom card import Card class Solitaire(ft.Stack):   def __init__(self):       super().__init__()       self.controls = []       self.slots = []       self.cards = []       self.width = SOLITAIRE_WIDTH       self.height = SOLITAIRE_HEIGHT    def did_mount(self):       self.create_card_deck()       self.create_slots()       self.deal_cards()    def create_card_deck(self):       card1 = Card(self, color="GREEN")       card2 = Card(self, color="YELLOW")       self.cards = [card1, card2]    def create_slots(self):       self.slots.append(Slot(top=0, left=0))       self.slots.append(Slot(top=0, left=200))       self.slots.append(Slot(top=0, left=300))       self.controls.extend(self.slots)       self.update()    def deal_cards(self):       self.controls.extend(self.cards)       for card in self.cards:           card.place(self.slots[0])       self.update()
```

note

If you try to call `create_slots()` and `create_card_deck()` and `deal_cards()` methods `__init__()` method of the Solitaire class, it will cause an error “Control must be added to the page first”. To fix this, we create slots and cards inside the `did_mount()` method, which happens immediately after the stack is added to the page.

Our main program will be very simple now:

```
import flet as ftfrom solitaire import Solitaire def main(page: ft.Page):     solitaire = Solitaire()    page.add(solitaire) ft.app(main)
```

You can find the full source code for this step [here](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/tree/main/python/tutorials/solitaire/solitaire-classes). It works exactly the same way as the proof of concept app, but re-written with the new classes to be ready for adding more complex functionality to it.

### Placing card with offset[​](/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire#placing-card-with-offset "Direct link to Placing card with offset")

When the card is being placed to a slot in the `card.place()` method, we need to do three things:

-   Remove the card from its original slot, if it exists
-   Change card’s slot to the new slot
-   Add the card to the new slot’s pile

```
def place(self, slot):    # remove card from it's original slot, if exists    if self.slot is not None:        self.slot.pile.remove(self)        # change card's slot to a new slot    self.slot = slot    # add card to the new slot's pile    slot.pile.append(self)
```

When updating card’s `top` and `left` position, `left` should remain the same, but `top` will depend on the length of the new slot’s pile:

```
    self.top = slot.top + len(slot.pile) * CARD_OFFSET    self.left = slot.left
```

Now the cards are placed with offset which gives us the fanned pile look:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire/img/docs/solitaire-tutorial/fanned_piles1.png)

### Drag pile of cards[​](/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire#drag-pile-of-cards "Direct link to Drag pile of cards")

If you try to drag the card from the bottom of the pile now, it will look like this:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire/img/docs/solitaire-tutorial/fanned_piles2.gif)

To fix this problem, we need to update all the methods that work with the draggable card to work with the draggable pile instead.

Let’s create `get_draggable_pile()` method that will get the list of cards that need to be dragged together, starting with the card you picked:

```
    def get_draggable_pile(self):        """returns list of cards that will be dragged together, starting with the current card"""        if self.slot is not None:            self.draggable_pile = self.slot.pile[self.slot.pile.index(self) :]        else:  # slot == None when the cards are dealt and need to be place in slot for the first time            self.draggable_pile = [self]
```

Then, we’ll update `move_on_top()` method:

```
    def move_on_top(self):        """Brings draggable card pile to the top of the stack"""        # for card in self.get_draggable_pile():        for card in self.draggable_pile:            self.solitaire.controls.remove(card)            self.solitaire.controls.append(card)        self.solitaire.update()
```

Additionally, we need to update `drag()` method to go through the draggable pile and update positions of all the cards being dragged:

```
    def drag(self, e: ft.DragUpdateEvent):        for card in self.draggable_pile:            card.top = (                max(0, self.top + e.delta_y)                + self.draggable_pile.index(card) * CARD_OFFSET            )            card.left = max(0, self.left + e.delta_x)            self.solitaire.update()
```

Also, we need to update `place()` method to place place the draggable pile to the slot:

```
    def place(self, slot):        """Place draggable pile to the slot"""        for card in self.draggable_pile:            card.top = slot.top + len(slot.pile) * CARD_OFFSET            card.left = slot.left            # remove card from it's original slot, if it exists            if card.slot is not None:                card.slot.pile.remove(card)            # change card's slot to a new slot            card.slot = slot            # add card to the new slot's pile            slot.pile.append(card)        self.solitaire.update()
```

Finally, if no slot in proximity is found, we need to bounce the whole pile back to its original position:

```
    def bounce_back(self):        """Returns draggable pile to its original position"""        for card in self.draggable_pile:            card.top = card.slot.top + card.slot.pile.index(card) * CARD_OFFSET            card.left = card.slot.left        self.solitaire.update()
```

The full source code of this step can be found [here](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/tree/main/python/tutorials/solitaire/solitaire-fanned-piles). Now we can drag and drop cards in fanned piles, which means we are ready for the real deal!

## Solitaire setup[​](/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire#solitaire-setup "Direct link to Solitaire setup")

Let’s take a look at the [wikipedia article about Klondike (solitaire)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klondike_\(solitaire\)#Rules):

> Klondike is played with a standard 52-card deck.

> After shuffling, a tableau of seven fanned piles of cards is laid from left to right. From left to right, each pile contains one more card than the last. The first and left-most pile contains a single upturned card, the second pile contains two cards, the third pile contains three cards, the fourth pile contains four cards, the fifth pile contains five cards, the sixth pile contains six cards, and the seventh pile contains seven cards. The topmost card of each pile is turned face up. The remaining cards form the stock and are placed facedown at the upper left of the layout.

> The four foundations (light rectangles in the upper right of the figure) are built up by suit from Ace (low in this game) to King, and the tableau piles can be built down by alternate colors.

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire/img/docs/solitaire-tutorial/game_setup_wiki.png)

We will now work on this setup step by step.

### Create card deck[​](/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire#create-card-deck "Direct link to Create card deck")

The first step is to create a full deck of cards in Solitaire class. Each card should have a `suit` property (hearts, diamonds, clubs and spades) and a `rank` property (from Ace to King). For the suit, its `color` is important, because tableau piles are built by alternate colors.

For the rank, its `value` is important, because foundations are built from the lowest (Ace) to the highest (King) rank value.

In solitaire.py, create `Suite` and `Rank` classes:

```
class Suite:    def __init__(self, suite_name, suite_color):        self.name = suite_name        self.color = suite_colorclass Rank:    def __init__(self, card_name, card_value):        self.name = card_name        self.value = card_value
```

Now, in the `Card` class, instead of accepting the color as an argument, we’ll be accepting `suite` and `rank` in `__init__()`. Additionally, we’ll add `face_up` property to the card and the Container will now has image of the back of the card as its `content`:

```
class Card(ft.GestureDetector):    def __init__(self, solitaire, suite, rank):        super().__init__()        self.mouse_cursor=ft.MouseCursor.MOVE        self.drag_interval=5        self.on_pan_start=self.start_drag        self.on_pan_update=self.drag        self.on_pan_end=self.drop        self.suite=suite        self.rank=rank        self.face_up=False        self.top=None        self.left=None        self.solitaire = solitaire        self.slot = None        self.content=ft.Container(            width=CARD_WIDTH,            height=CARD_HEIGTH,            border_radius = ft.border_radius.all(6),            content=ft.Image(src="card_back.png"))
```

All the images for the face up cards, as well as card back are stored in the “images” folder in the same directory as main.py.

note

For the reference to the image file to work, we need to specify the folder were it resides in the assets\_dir in main.py:

```
ft.app(main, assets_dir="images")
```

Finally, in `solitaire.create_card_deck()` we'll create lists of suites and ranks and then the 52-card deck:

```
def create_card_deck(self):    suites = [        Suite("hearts", "RED"),        Suite("diamonds", "RED"),        Suite("clubs", "BLACK"),        Suite("spades", "BLACK"),    ]    ranks = [        Rank("Ace", 1),        Rank("2", 2),        Rank("3", 3),        Rank("4", 4),        Rank("5", 5),        Rank("6", 6),        Rank("7", 7),        Rank("8", 8),        Rank("9", 9),        Rank("10", 10),        Rank("Jack", 11),        Rank("Queen", 12),        Rank("King", 13),    ]    self.cards = []    for suite in suites:        for rank in ranks:            self.cards.append(Card(solitaire=self, suite=suite, rank=rank))
```

The card deck is ready to be dealt, and now we need to create the layout for it.

### Create slots[​](/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire#create-slots "Direct link to Create slots")

Klondike solitaire game layout should look like this:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire/img/docs/solitaire-tutorial/solitaire-layout.svg)

Let’s create all those slots in `solitaire.create_slots()`:

```
def create_slots(self):        self.stock = Slot(top=0, left=0, border=ft.border.all(1))    self.waste = Slot(top=0, left=100, border=None)    self.foundations = []    x = 300    for i in range(4):        self.foundations.append(Slot(top=0, left=x, border=ft.border.all(1, "outline")))        x += 100    self.tableau = []    x = 0    for i in range(7):        self.tableau.append(Slot(top=150, left=x, border=None))        x += 100    self.controls.append(self.stock)    self.controls.append(self.waste)    self.controls.extend(self.foundations)    self.controls.extend(self.tableau)    self.update()
```

note

Note: some slots should have visible border and some shouldn’t, so we added border to the list of arguments for the creation of `Slot` objects.

### Deal cards[​](/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire#deal-cards "Direct link to Deal cards")

Let's start with shuffling the cards and adding them to the list of controls:

```
def deal_cards(self):    random.shuffle(self.cards)    self.controls.extend(self.cards)    self.update()
```

Then we'll deal the cards to the tableau piles from left to right so that each pile contains one more card than the last, and place the remaining cards to the stock pile:

```
def deal_cards(self):    random.shuffle(self.cards)    self.controls.extend(self.cards)        # deal to tableau    first_slot = 0    remaining_cards = self.cards        while first_slot < len(self.tableau):        for slot in self.tableau[first_slot:]:            top_card = remaining_cards[0]            top_card.place(slot)            remaining_cards.remove(top_card)        first_slot +=1    # place remaining cards to stock pile    for card in remaining_cards:        card.place(self.stock)        self.update()
```

Let’s run the program and see where we are at now:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire/img/docs/solitaire-tutorial/game_setup1.png)

Cards in stock were placed in a fanned pile in the same manner as to the tableau, but they should have been placed to a regular pile instead. To fix this problem, let’s add this condition to the `card.place()` method:

```
def place(self, slot):    """Place draggable pile to the slot"""    if slot in self.solitaire.tableau:        self.top = slot.top + len(slot.pile) * self.solitaire.card_offset    else:        self.top = slot.top    self.left = slot.left
```

Now cards are only placed in fanned piles to tableau:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire/img/docs/solitaire-tutorial/game_setup2.png)

If you try moving the cards around now, the program won’t work. The reason for this is that in the `card.drop()` method iterates through list of slots which we don’t have now.

Let’s update the method to go separately through foundations and tableau:

```
def drop(self, e: ft.DragEndEvent):    for slot in self.solitaire.tableau:        if (            abs(self.top - (slot.top + len(slot.pile) * CARD_OFFSET)) < DROP_PROXIMITY        and abs(self.left - slot.left) < DROP_PROXIMITY        ):            self.place(slot)            self.solitaire.update()            return    for slot in self.solitaire.foundations:        if (            abs(self.top - slot.top) < DROP_PROXIMITY        and abs(self.left - slot.left) < DROP_PROXIMITY        ):            self.place(slot)            self.solitaire.update()            return            self.bounce_back()
```

### Reveal top cards in tableau piles[​](/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire#reveal-top-cards-in-tableau-piles "Direct link to Reveal top cards in tableau piles")

Now we have the correct game setup and as a last touch we need to reveal the topmost cards in tableau piles.

In `Slot` class, create a `get_top_card()` method:

```
def get_top_card(self):    if len(self.pile) > 0:        return self.pile[-1]
```

In `Card` class, create `turn_dace_up()` method:

```
def turn_face_up(self):    self.face_up = True    self.content.content.src=f"/images/{self.rank.name}_{self.suite.name}.svg"    self.solitaire.update()
```

Finally, reveal the topmost cards in the `solitaire.deal_cards()`:

```
for slot in self.tableau:    slot.get_top_card().turn_face_up()    self.update()
```

Let’s see how it looks now:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire/img/docs/solitaire-tutorial/game_setup3.png)

The full source code for this step can be found [here](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/tree/main/python/tutorials/solitaire/solitaire-game-setup).

Congratulations on completing the Solitaire game setup! You’ve created a full 52-card deck, built layout with stock, waste, foundations and tableau piles, dealt the cards and revealed the top cards in tableau. Let’s move on to the next item on our todo list, which is Solitaire Rules.

## Solitaire rules[​](/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire#solitaire-rules "Direct link to Solitaire rules")

If you run your current version of Solitaire, you’ll notice that you can do some crazy things with your cards:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire/img/docs/solitaire-tutorial/game_rules1.gif)

Now it is time to implement some rules.

### General rules[​](/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire#general-rules "Direct link to General rules")

Currently, we can move any card, but only face-up cards should be moved. Let’s add this check in `start_drag`, `drag` and `drop` methods of the card:

```
def start_drag(self, e: ft.DragStartEvent):    if self.face_up:        self.move_on_top()        self.solitaire.update()def drag(self, e: ft.DragUpdateEvent):    if self.face_up:        for card in self.draggable_pile:            card.top = max(0, self.top + e.delta_y) + self.draggable_pile.index(card) * CARD_OFFSET            card.left = max(0, self.left + e.delta_x)            card.solitaire.update()def drop(self, e: ft.DragEndEvent):    if self.face_up:        for slot in self.solitaire.tableau:            if (                abs(self.top - (slot.top + len(slot.pile) * CARD_OFFSET)) < DROP_PROXIMITY            and abs(self.left - slot.left) < DROP_PROXIMITY        ):                self.place(slot)                return                for slot in self.solitaire.foundations:            if (                    abs(self.top - slot.top) < DROP_PROXIMITY            and abs(self.left - slot.left) < DROP_PROXIMITY        ):                self.place(slot)                return            self.bounce_back()
```

Now let’s specify `click` method for the `on_tap` event of the card to reveal the card if you click on a faced-down top card in a tableau pile:

```
def click(self, e):    if self.slot in self.solitaire.tableau:        if not self.face_up and self == self.slot.get_top_card():            self.turn_face_up()            self.solitaire.update()
```

Let's check how it works:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire/img/docs/solitaire-tutorial/game_rules2.gif)

### Foundations rules[​](/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire#foundations-rules "Direct link to Foundations rules")

At the moment we can place fanned piles to foundations, which shouldn’t be allowed. Let’s check the draggable pile length to fix it:

```
def drop(self, e: ft.DragEndEvent):    for slot in self.solitaire.tableau:        if (            abs(self.top - (slot.top + len(slot.pile) * CARD_OFFSET)) < DROP_PROXIMITY        and abs(self.left - slot.left) < DROP_PROXIMITY        ):            self.place(slot)            return        if len(self.draggable_pile) == 1:        for slot in self.solitaire.foundations:            if (                abs(self.top - slot.top) < DROP_PROXIMITY        and abs(self.left - slot.left) < DROP_PROXIMITY        ):                self.place(slot)                return            self.bounce_back()
```

Then, of course, not any card can be placed to a foundation. According to the rules, a foundation should start with an Ace and then the cards of the same suite can be placed on top of it to build a pile form Ace to King.

Let’s add this rule to Solitaire class:

```
def check_foundations_rules(self, card, slot):    top_card = slot.get_top_card()    if top_card is not None:        return (            card.suite.name == top_card.suite.name            and card.rank.value - top_card.rank.value == 1        )    else:        return card.rank.name == "Ace"
```

We’ll check this rule in `drop()` method before placing a card to a foundation slot:

```
def drop(self, e: ft.DragEndEvent):    if self.face_up:        for slot in self.solitaire.tableau:            if (                abs(self.top - (slot.top + len(slot.pile) * CARD_OFFSET)) < DROP_PROXIMITY            and abs(self.left - slot.left) < DROP_PROXIMITY        ):                self.place(slot)                return                if len(self.draggable_pile) == 1:            for slot in self.solitaire.foundations:                if (                    abs(self.top - slot.top) < DROP_PROXIMITY            and abs(self.left - slot.left) < DROP_PROXIMITY        ) and self.solitaire.check_foundations_rules(self, slot):                    self.place(slot)                    return                self.bounce_back()
```

As a final touch for foundations rules, let’s implement `doublclick` method for `on_double_tap` event of a card. It will be checking if the faced-up card fits into any of the foundations and place it there:

```
   def double-click(self, e):       self.get_draggable_pile()       if self.face_up and len(self.draggable_pile == 1):           self.move_on_top()           for slot in self.solitaire.foundations:               if self.solitaire.check_foundations_rules(self, slot):                   self.place(slot)                   return
```

### Tableau rules[​](/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire#tableau-rules "Direct link to Tableau rules")

Finally, let's implement the rules to build tableau piles down from King to Ace by alternating suite color. Additionally, only King can be placed to an empty tableau slot.

Let’s add these rules for Solitaire class:

```
def check_tableau_rules(self, card, slot):    top_card = slot.get_top_card()    if top_card is not None:        return (            card.suite.color != top_card.suite.color            and top_card.rank.value - card.rank.value == 1            and top_card.face_up        )    else:        return card.rank.name == "King"
```

Similarly to the foundations rules, we’ll check tableau rules before placing a card to a tableau pile:

```
def drop(self, e: ft.DragEndEvent):    if self.face_up:        for slot in self.solitaire.tableau:            if (                abs(self.top - (slot.top + len(slot.pile) * CARD_OFFSET)) < DROP_PROXIMITY            and abs(self.left - slot.left) < DROP_PROXIMITY        ) and self.solitaire.check_tableau_rules(self, slot):                self.place(slot)                return                if len(self.draggable_pile) == 1:            for slot in self.solitaire.foundations:                if (                    abs(self.top - slot.top) < DROP_PROXIMITY            and abs(self.left - slot.left) < DROP_PROXIMITY        ) and self.solitaire.check_foundations_rules(self, slot):                    self.place(slot)                    return                self.bounce_back()
```

### Stock and waste[​](/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire#stock-and-waste "Direct link to Stock and waste")

To properly play Solitaire game right now we are missing the remaining cards that are piled in the stock.

Let’s update `click()` method of the card to go through the stock pile and place the cards to waste as we go:

```
def click(self, e):    if self.slot in self.solitaire.tableau:        if not self.face_up and self == self.slot.get_top_card():            self.turn_face_up()    elif self.slot == self.solitaire.stock:        self.move_on_top()        self.place(self.solitaire.waste)        self.turn_face_up()
```

That’s it! Now you can properly play solitaire, but it very difficult to win the game if you cannot pass though the waste again. Let’s implement `click()` for `on_click` event of the stock Slot to go thought the stock pile again:

```
class Slot(ft.Container):   def __init__(self, solitaire, top, left, border):       super().__init__()       self.pile=[]       self.width=SLOT_WIDTH       self.height=SLOT_HEIGHT       self.left=left       self.top=top       self.on_click=self.click       self.solitaire=solitaire       self.border=border       self.border_radius = ft.border_radius.all(6)     def click(self, e):       if self == self.solitaire.stock:           self.solitaire.restart_stock()
```

`restart_stock()` method in `Solitaire` class will place all cards from waste to stock again:

```
def restart_stock(self):    while len(self.waste.pile) > 0:        card = self.waste.get_top_card()        card.turn_face_down()        card.move_on_top()        card.place(self.stock)   
```

For `card.place()` method to work properly with cards from Stock and Waste, we’ve added a condition to `card.get_draggable_pile()`, so that it returns the top card only and not the whole pile:

```
    def get_draggable_pile(self):        """returns list of cards that will be dragged together, starting with the current card"""        if (            self.slot is not None            and self.slot != self.solitaire.stock            and self.slot != self.solitaire.waste        ):            self.draggable_pile = self.slot.pile[self.slot.pile.index(self) :]        else:  # slot == None when the cards are dealt and need to be place in slot for the first time            self.draggable_pile = [self]
```

All done! The full source code for this step can be found [here](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/tree/main/python/tutorials/solitaire/solitaire-game-rules).

Let’s move on to the last step of the game itself - detecting the situation when you have won.

## Winning the game[​](/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire#winning-the-game "Direct link to Winning the game")

According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klondike_\(solitaire\)#Probability_of_winning), some suggest the chances of winning the game as being 1 in 30 games.

Knowing that the chances of winning are quite low, we should plan on showing the user something exciting when that finally happens.

First, let’s add a check for the winning condition to `Solitaire` class. If all four foundations contain total of 52 cards, then you have won:

```
def check_win(self):    cards_num = 0    for slot in self.foundations:        cards_num += len(slot.pile)    if cards_num == 52:        return True    return False
```

We’ll be checking if this condition is true each time a card is placed to a foundation:

```
def place(self, slot):    """Place draggable pile to the slot"""        draggable_pile = self.get_draggable_pile()    for card in draggable_pile:        if slot in self.solitaire.tableau:            card.top = slot.top + len(slot.pile) * CARD_OFFSET        else:            card.top = slot.top        card.left = slot.left        # remove card from it's original slot, if exists        if card.slot is not None:            card.slot.pile.remove(card)            # change card's slot to a new slot        card.slot = slot        # add card to the new slot's pile        slot.pile.append(card)        if self.solitaire.check_win():        self.solitaire.winning_sequence()        self.solitaire.update()
```

Finally, if the winning condition is met, it will trigger a winning sequence involving [position animation](https://flet.dev/docs/cookbook/animations#position-animation):

```
def winning_sequence(self):    for slot in self.foundations:           for card in slot.pile:            card.animate_position=1000            card.move_on_top()            card.top = random.randint(0, SOLITAIRE_HEIGHT)            card.left = random.randint(0, SOLITAIRE_WIDTH)            self.update()    self.controls.append(ft.AlertDialog(title=ft.Text("Congratulations! You won!"), open=True))
```

Wow! We did it. You can find the full source code for the Solitaire game [here](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/tree/main/python/tutorials/solitaire/solitaire-final-part1).

# Creating chat app in Python

In this tutorial we are going to create a trivial in-memory Chat app that will help you understand Flet framework basics. This app could be a good starting point to creating your own more complex and useful projects.

In this tutorial you will learn how to:

-   [Create your first Flet app](/docs/tutorials/python-chat#getting-started-with-flet)
-   [Add page controls and handle events](/docs/tutorials/python-chat#adding-page-controls-and-handling-events)
-   [Broadcast messages using built-in PubSub library](/docs/tutorials/python-chat#broadcasting-chat-messages)
-   [Use AlertDialog control for accepting user name](/docs/tutorials/python-chat#user-name-dialog)
-   [Enhance user interface with reusable controls](/docs/tutorials/python-chat#enhancing-user-interface)
-   [Deploy the app as a web app](/docs/tutorials/python-chat#deploying-the-app)

The complete application will look like this:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-chat/img/docs/chat-tutorial/chat.gif)

You can play with a live demo [here](https://flet-chat.fly.dev).

The full code for the chat app can be found [here](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/main/python/tutorials/chat/chat.py).

## Getting started with Flet[​](/docs/tutorials/python-chat#getting-started-with-flet "Direct link to Getting started with Flet")

It's a tradition to start with "Hello, world!" app!

To create a multi-platform app in Python with Flet, you don't need to know HTML, CSS or JavaScript, but you do need a basic knowledge of Python and object-oriented programming.

Before you can create your first Flet app, you need to [setup your development environment](/docs/getting-started/), which requires Python 3.9 or above and `flet` package.

Once you have Flet installed, let's [create](/docs/getting-started/create-flet-app) a simple hello-world app.

Create `hello.py` with the following contents:

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    page.add(ft.Text(value="Hello, world!"))ft.app(main)
```

Run this app and you will see a new window with a greeting:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-chat/img/docs/tutorial/todo-app-hello-world.png)

## Adding page controls and handling events[​](/docs/tutorials/python-chat#adding-page-controls-and-handling-events "Direct link to Adding page controls and handling events")

To start, we want to be able to take user input (chat message) and show messages history on the screen. The layout for this step could look like this:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-chat/img/docs/chat-tutorial/chat-layout-1.svg)

To implement this layout, we will be using these Flet controls:

-   [Column](/docs/controls/column) - a container to display chat messages (Text controls) vertically.
-   [Text](/docs/controls/text) - chat message displayed in the chat Column.
-   [TextField](/docs/controls/textfield) - input control used for taking new message input from the user.
-   [ElevatedButton](/docs/controls/elevatedbutton) - "Send" button that will add new message to the chat Column.
-   [Row](/docs/controls/row) - a container to display TextField and ElevatedButton horizontally.

Create `chat.py` with the following contents:

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):    chat = ft.Column()    new_message = ft.TextField()    def send_click(e):        chat.controls.append(ft.Text(new_message.value))        new_message.value = ""        page.update()    page.add(        chat, ft.Row(controls=[new_message, ft.ElevatedButton("Send", on_click=send_click)])    )ft.app(main)
```

When user clicks on the "Send" button, it triggers `on_click` event which calls `send_click` method. `send_click` then adds new `Text` control to the list of Column `controls` and clears `new_message` TextField value.

note

After any properties of a control are updated, an `update()` method of the control (or its parent control) should be called for the update to take effect.

Chat app now looks like this:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-chat/img/docs/chat-tutorial/chat-1.png)

## Broadcasting chat messages[​](/docs/tutorials/python-chat#broadcasting-chat-messages "Direct link to Broadcasting chat messages")

In the previous step we have created a simple app that takes input from the user and displays chats messages on the screen.

If you open this app in two web browser tabs, it will create two app sessions. Each session will have its own list of messages.

note

To open open your app in two web browser tabs locally, run the following command:

```
flet run --web <path_to_your_app>
```

Once it is opened, copy the url and paste it into a new tab.

To build a realtime chat app, you need to somehow pass the messages between chat app sessions. When a user sends a message, it should be broadcasted to all other app sessions and displayed on their pages.

Flet provides a simple built-in [PubSub](/docs/cookbook/pub-sub) mechanism for asynchronous communication between page sessions.

First, we need subscribe the user to receive broadcast messages:

```
    page.pubsub.subscribe(on_message)
```

`pubsub.subscribe()` method will add current app session to the list of subscribers. It accepts `handler` as an argument, that will later be called at the moment a publisher calls `pubsub.send_all()` method.

In the `handler` we will be adding new message (`Text`) to the list of chat `controls`:

```
    def on_message(message: Message):        chat.controls.append(ft.Text(f"{message.user}: {message.text}"))        page.update()
```

Finally, you need to call `pubsub.send_all()` method when the user clicks on "Send" button:

```
    def send_click(e):        page.pubsub.send_all(Message(user=page.session_id, text=new_message.value))        new_message.value = ""        page.update()    page.add(chat, ft.Row([new_message, ft.ElevatedButton("Send", on_click=send_click)]))   
```

`pubsub.send_all()` will call the `on_message()` and pass on the Message object down to it.

Here is the full code for this step:

```
import flet as ftclass Message():    def __init__(self, user: str, text: str):        self.user = user        self.text = textdef main(page: ft.Page):    chat = ft.Column()    new_message = ft.TextField()    def on_message(message: Message):        chat.controls.append(ft.Text(f"{message.user}: {message.text}"))        page.update()    page.pubsub.subscribe(on_message)    def send_click(e):        page.pubsub.send_all(Message(user=page.session_id, text=new_message.value))        new_message.value = ""        page.update()    page.add(chat, ft.Row([new_message, ft.ElevatedButton("Send", on_click=send_click)]))ft.app(main)
```

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-chat/img/docs/chat-tutorial/chat-2.gif)

## User name dialog[​](/docs/tutorials/python-chat#user-name-dialog "Direct link to User name dialog")

Chat app that you have created in the previous step has basic functionality needed to exchange messages between user sessions. It is not very user-friendly though, since it shows `session_id` that sent a message, which doesn't tell much about who you are communicating with.

Let's improve our app to show user name instead of `session_id` for each message. To capture user name, we will be using [`AlertDialog`](/docs/controls/alertdialog) control. Let's add it to the page:

```
    user_name = ft.TextField(label="Enter your name")    page.dialog = ft.AlertDialog(        open=True,        modal=True,        title=ft.Text("Welcome!"),        content=ft.Column([user_name], tight=True),        actions=[ft.ElevatedButton(text="Join chat", on_click=join_click)],        actions_alignment="end",    )
```

note

A dialog will be opened on the start of the program since we have set its `open` property to `True`.

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-chat/img/docs/chat-tutorial/username-dialog.png)

When the user clicks on "Join chat" button, it will call `join_click` method that should send a message to all subscribers, informing them that the user has joined the chat. This message should look different from the regular chat message, for example, like this:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-chat/img/docs/chat-tutorial/chat-4.png)

Let's add `message_type` property to the `Message` class to differentiate between login and chat messages:

```
class Message():    def __init__(self, user: str, text: str, message_type: str):        self.user = user        self.text = text        self.message_type = message_type
```

We will be checking `message_type` in `on_message` method:

```
def on_message(message: Message):    if message.message_type == "chat_message":        chat.controls.append(ft.Text(f"{message.user}: {message.text}"))    elif message.message_type == "login_message":        chat.controls.append(            ft.Text(message.text, italic=True, color=ft.Colors.BLACK45, size=12)        )    page.update()
```

Messages of "login\_message" and "chat\_message" types will now be sent on two events: when user joins the chat and when user sends a message.

Let's create `join_click` method:

```
def join_click(e):    if not user_name.value:        user_name.error_text = "Name cannot be blank!"        user_name.update()    else:        page.session.set("user_name", user_name.value)        page.dialog.open = False        page.pubsub.send_all(Message(user=user_name.value, text=f"{user_name.value} has joined the chat.", message_type="login_message"))        page.update()
```

We used [page session storage](/docs/cookbook/session-storage) to store user\_name for its future use in `send_click` method to send chat messages.

note

User name dialog will close as soon as we set its `open` property to `False` and call `update()` method.

Finally, let's update `send_click` method to use `user_name` that we previously saved using `page.session`:

```
def send_click(e):    page.pubsub.send_all(Message(user=page.session.get('user_name'), text=new_message.value, message_type="chat_message"))    new_message.value = ""    page.update()
```

The full code for this step can be found [here](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/main/python/tutorials/chat/chat_3.py).

## Enhancing user interface[​](/docs/tutorials/python-chat#enhancing-user-interface "Direct link to Enhancing user interface")

Chat app that you have created in the previous step already serves its purpose of exchanging messages between users with basic login functionality.

Before moving on to [deploying your app](/docs/tutorials/python-chat#deploying-the-app), we suggest adding some extra features to it that will improve user experience and make the app look more professional.

### Reusable user controls[​](/docs/tutorials/python-chat#reusable-user-controls "Direct link to Reusable user controls")

You may want to show messages in a different format, like this:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-chat/img/docs/chat-tutorial/chat-layout-chatmessage.svg)

Chat message will now be a `Row` containing [`CircleAvatar`](/docs/controls/circleavatar) with username initials and `Column` that contains two `Text` controls: user name and message text.

We will need to show quite a few chat messages in the chat app, so it makes sense to create your own [reusable control](/docs/getting-started/custom-controls). Lets create a new `ChatMessage` class that will inherit from `Row`.

When creating an instance of `ChatMessage` class, we will pass a `Message` object as an argument and then `ChatMessage` will display itself based on `message.user_name` and `message.text`:

```
class ChatMessage(ft.Row):    def __init__(self, message: Message):        super().__init__()        self.vertical_alignment = ft.CrossAxisAlignment.START        self.controls=[                ft.CircleAvatar(                    content=ft.Text(self.get_initials(message.user_name)),                    color=ft.Colors.WHITE,                    bgcolor=self.get_avatar_color(message.user_name),                ),                ft.Column(                    [                        ft.Text(message.user_name, weight="bold"),                        ft.Text(message.text, selectable=True),                    ],                    tight=True,                    spacing=5,                ),            ]    def get_initials(self, user_name: str):        return user_name[:1].capitalize()    def get_avatar_color(self, user_name: str):        colors_lookup = [            ft.Colors.AMBER,            ft.Colors.BLUE,            ft.Colors.BROWN,            ft.Colors.CYAN,            ft.Colors.GREEN,            ft.Colors.INDIGO,            ft.Colors.LIME,            ft.Colors.ORANGE,            ft.Colors.PINK,            ft.Colors.PURPLE,            ft.Colors.RED,            ft.Colors.TEAL,            ft.Colors.YELLOW,        ]        return colors_lookup[hash(user_name) % len(colors_lookup)]
```

`ChatMessage` control extracts initials and algorithmically derives avatar color from a username. Later, if you decide to improve control layout or its logic, it won't affect the rest of the program - that's the power of encapsulation!

### Laying out controls[​](/docs/tutorials/python-chat#laying-out-controls "Direct link to Laying out controls")

Now you can use your brand new `ChatMessage` to build a better layout for the chat app:

![](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-chat/img/docs/chat-tutorial/chat-layout-2.svg)

Instances of `ChatMessage` will be created instead of plain `Text` chat messages in `on_message` method:

```
    def on_message(message: Message):        if message.message_type == "chat_message":            m = ChatMessage(message)        elif message.message_type == "login_message":            m = ft.Text(message.text, italic=True, color=ft.Colors.BLACK45, size=12)        chat.controls.append(m)        page.update()
```

Other improvements suggested with the new layout are:

-   [`ListView`](/docs/controls/listview) instead of `Column` for displaying messages, to be able to scroll through the messages later
-   `Container` for displaying border around `ListView`
-   [`IconButton`](/docs/controls/iconbutton) instead of `ElevatedButton` to send messages
-   Use of [`expand`](/docs/controls#expand) property for controls to fill available space

Here is how you can implement this layout:

```
    # Chat messages    chat = ft.ListView(        expand=True,        spacing=10,        auto_scroll=True,    )    # A new message entry form    new_message = ft.TextField(        hint_text="Write a message...",        autofocus=True,        shift_enter=True,        min_lines=1,        max_lines=5,        filled=True,        expand=True,        on_submit=send_message_click,    )    # Add everything to the page    page.add(        ft.Container(            content=chat,            border=ft.border.all(1, ft.Colors.OUTLINE),            border_radius=5,            padding=10,            expand=True,        ),        ft.Row(            [                new_message,                ft.IconButton(                    icon=ft.Icons.SEND_ROUNDED,                    tooltip="Send message",                    on_click=send_message_click,                ),            ]        ),    )
```

The full code for this step can be found [here](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/main/python/tutorials/chat/chat.py).

This is the final version of the chat app for the purpose of this tutorial. Below you can read more about the enhancements that we have made.

### Keyboard support[​](/docs/tutorials/python-chat#keyboard-support "Direct link to Keyboard support")

#### Focusing input controls[​](/docs/tutorials/python-chat#focusing-input-controls "Direct link to Focusing input controls")

All data entry controls have `autofocus` property which when set to `True` moves initial focus to the control. If there is more than one control on a page with `autofocus` set, then the first one added to the page will get focus.

We set `autofocus=True` on a username TextField inside a dialog and then on a TextField for entering chat message to set initial focus on it when the dialog is closed.

When a user click "Send" button or presses Enter to submit a chat message, TextField loses focus. To programmatically set control focus we used [`TextField.focus()`](/docs/controls/textfield#focus) method.

#### Submitting forms on `Enter`[​](/docs/tutorials/python-chat#submitting-forms-on-enter "Direct link to submitting-forms-on-enter")

It's so tempting to submit forms with just pushing `Enter` button on the keyboard! Type your name in the dialog, hit `Enter`, type a new message, hit `Enter`, type another, hit `Enter` - no mouse involved at all! 🚀

Flet has support for that by providing [`TextField.on_submit`](/docs/controls/textfield#on_submit) event handler which fires when a user press `Enter` button while the focus is on the TextField.

#### Entering multiline messages[​](/docs/tutorials/python-chat#entering-multiline-messages "Direct link to Entering multiline messages")

What about multiline TextFields where `Enter` must advance a cursor to the next line? We've got that covered too! `TextField` control has [`shift_enter`](/docs/controls/textfield#shift_enter) property which when set to `True` enables Discord-like behavior: to get to a new line user presses `Shift`+`Enter` while hitting just `Enter` submits a form.

### Animated scrolling to the last message[​](/docs/tutorials/python-chat#animated-scrolling-to-the-last-message "Direct link to Animated scrolling to the last message")

Noticed a nice animation of scrolling to the last message in a chat window? It could be enabled by setting [`ListView.auto_scroll`](/docs/controls/listview#auto_scroll) property to `True`. The top most `Page` class, being a scrollable container itself, also supports [`auto_scroll`](/docs/controls/page#auto_scroll).

### Page title[​](/docs/tutorials/python-chat#page-title "Direct link to Page title")

Final touch - page title that could be changed as simply as:

```
page.title = "Flet Chat"page.update()
```

## Deploying the app[​](/docs/tutorials/python-chat#deploying-the-app "Direct link to Deploying the app")

# Colors

![](https://flet.dev/docs/reference/colors/img/docs/colors/color_palettes.png)

## Color value[​](/docs/reference/colors#color-value "Direct link to Color value")

There are 2 ways to define color property value in Flet: hex value and named colors.

### Hex value[​](/docs/reference/colors#hex-value "Direct link to Hex value")

Hex value should be in format `#aarrggbb` (`0xaarrggbb`) or `#rrggbb` (`0xeeggbb`). In case `aa` ([opacity](/docs/reference/colors#color-opacity)) is omitted, it is set to `ff` (not transparent).

```
c1 = ft.Container(bgcolor='#ff0000')
```

[Live example](https://flet-controls-gallery.fly.dev/colors/controlcolors)

### Named colors[​](/docs/reference/colors#named-colors "Direct link to Named colors")

Named colors are the Material Design [theme colors](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/the-color-system/color-roles) and [colors palettes](https://m2.material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#color-usage-and-palettes). They can either be set with a string value or using the `Colors` or `CupertinoColors` enums.

```
c1 = ft.Container(bgcolor=ft.Colors.YELLOW)c2 = ft.Container(bgcolor='yellow')
```

#### Theme colors[​](/docs/reference/colors#theme-colors "Direct link to Theme colors")

![](https://flet.dev/docs/reference/colors/img/docs/colors/theme_colors.png)

[Live Example](https://flet-controls-gallery.fly.dev/colors/themecolors)

There are 30 named theme colors in [`Theme.color_scheme`](/docs/reference/types/colorscheme) that are are generated based on the `color_scheme_seed` property. The default seed color value is "blue".

```
# example for generating page theme colors based on the seed colorpage.theme = Theme(color_scheme_seed=ft.Colors.GREEN)page.update()
```

Any of the 30 colors can be overridden, in which case they will have an absolute value that will not be dependent on the seed color.

```
page.theme = ft.Theme(    color_scheme=ft.ColorScheme(        primary=ft.Colors.GREEN,        primary_container=ft.Colors.GREEN_200        # ...    ),)
```

![](https://flet.dev/docs/reference/colors/img/docs/colors/theme_colors_green.png)

Theme colors define fallback colors for most of Flet controls.

#### Color palettes[​](/docs/reference/colors#color-palettes "Direct link to Color palettes")

![](https://flet.dev/docs/reference/colors/img/docs/colors/color_palettes_2.png)

[Live example](https://flet-controls-gallery.fly.dev/colors/colorspalettes)

Originally created by Material Design in 2014, color palettes are comprised of colors designed to work together harmoniously.

Color swatches (palettes) consist of different shades of a certain color. Most swatches have shades from `100` to `900` in increments of one hundred, plus the color `50`. The smaller the number, the more pale the color. The greater the number, the darker the color. The accent swatches (e.g. `redAccent`) only have the values `100`, `200`, `400`, and `700`.

In addition, a series of blacks and whites with common opacities are available. For example, `black54` is a pure black with 54% opacity.

Palette colors can be used for setting individual controls color property or as a seed color for generating Theme colors.

## Color opacity[​](/docs/reference/colors#color-opacity "Direct link to Color opacity")

You can specify opacity for any color (hex value or named) using `with_opacity` method. Opacity value should be between `0.0` (completely transparent) and `1.0` (not transparent).

```
color = ft.Colors.with_opacity(0.5, ft.Colors.PRIMARY)color = ft.Colors.with_opacity(0.5, '#ff6666')
```

Another way to specify opacity for string value:

```
color = "surface,0.5"
```

For hex value, you can specify `aa` channel with values between `00` and `ff`, for example:

```
color = "#7fff6666"
```

## Defining colors for Flet controls[​](/docs/reference/colors#defining-colors-for-flet-controls "Direct link to Defining colors for Flet controls")

Most Flet controls have default colors defined by the `color_scheme` that can be overridden on different levels.

[Live example](https://flet-controls-gallery.fly.dev/colors/controlcolors)

### Control level[​](/docs/reference/colors#control-level "Direct link to Control level")

If the color is defined on the control level, it will be used.

```
c = ft.Container(width=100, height=100, bgcolor=ft.Colors.GREEN_200)
```

Not every Flet control has a color property that can be set on the control level. For example, `FilledButton` always has a default "primary" color defined by the nearest ancestor's `theme`.

### Control Theme level[​](/docs/reference/colors#control-theme-level "Direct link to Control Theme level")

For `ScrollBar` (used in scrollable controls: `Page`, `View`, `Column`, `Row`, `ListView` and `GridView`), `Tabs` and `Text` controls, Flet will check if the [nearest anscestor](/blog/scrolling-controls-and-theming#nested-themes) theme has [ScrollBar Theme](/blog/scrolling-controls-and-theming#scrollbar-theme), [Tabs theme](/blog/scrolling-controls-and-theming#tabs-theming) or [Text theme](/blog/scrolling-controls-and-theming#text-theming) specified.

note

If you need to change theme for a particular ScrollBar, Text or Tabs control, you can wrap this control in a Container and customize `scrollbar_theme`, `text_theme` or `tabs_theme` for this Container `theme`.

### Theme level[​](/docs/reference/colors#theme-level "Direct link to Theme level")

Flet will check for the nearest ancestor that has `theme` defined, and will take color from the `ColorScheme`. In the example below, the nearest anscestor for the `FilledButton` is `Container`, and the `primary` color that is used for the button will be taken from the Container's `theme`.

```
import flet as ftdef main(page: ft.Page):              page.add(        ft.Container(            width=200,            height=200,            border=ft.border.all(1, ft.Colors.BLACK),            content=ft.FilledButton("Primary color"),            theme=ft.Theme(color_scheme=ft.ColorScheme(primary=ft.Colors.YELLOW))        )    )ft.app(main)   
```

If control's color property, control-specific theme or nearest ancestor's theme is not specified, the nearest ancestor will be the page and the colors from the default page `color_scheme` will be used.

## Methods[​](/docs/reference/colors#methods "Direct link to Methods")

### `random()`[​](/docs/reference/colors#random "Direct link to random")

Returns a random color, with optional exclusions and weights.

**Method Parameters:**

-   `exclude` - A list of icons members to exclude from the random selection.
-   `weights` - A dictionary mapping icon members to their respective weights for weighted random selection.

## Example[​](/docs/reference/colors#example "Direct link to Example")

```
>>> import flet as ft>>> ft.Icons.ABC>>> ft.CupertinoIcons.BACK>>> ft.Icons.random()>>> ft.CupertinoIcons.random()>>> ft.Icons.random(exclude=[ft.Icons.FAVORITE, ft.Icons.SCHOOL], weights={ft.Icons.SCHOOL: 150, ft.Icons.ADJUST: 5})>>> ft.CupertinoIcons.random(exclude=[ft.CupertinoIcons.CAMERA, ft.CupertinoIcons.TABLE], weights={ft.CupertinoIcons.TABLE: 150, ft.CupertinoIcons.PENCIL: 5})

# Built-in binary Python packages for Android and iOS

Binary Python packages (vs "pure" Python packages written in Python only) are packages that partially written in C, Rust or other languages producing native code. Example packages are `numpy`, `cryptography`, or `pydantic`.

Flet provides an alternative index [https://pypi.flet.dev](https://pypi.flet.dev) to host Python binary wheels (`.whl` files downloaded by pip) for iOS and Android platforms.

This is the list of packages that are currently available for Android and iOS:

New packages can be built with creating a recipe in [Mobile Forge](https://github.com/flet-dev/mobile-forge) project. For now, Flet team is authoring those recipes for you, but when the process is polished and fully-automated you'll be able to send a PR and test the compiled package right away.

If you don't yet see a package at [https://pypi.flet.dev](https://pypi.flet.dev) you can request it in [Flet discussions - Packages](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet/discussions/categories/packages). Please do not request pure Python packages. Go to package's "Download files" section at [https://pypi.org](https://pypi.org) and make sure it contains binary platform-specific wheels.

# Alignment

Used to define an alignment relative to the center.

`Alignment` class has the following properties:

### `x`[​](/docs/reference/types/alignment#x "Direct link to x")

Represents the horizontal distance from the center. It's value ranges between `-1.0` and `1.0`.

### `y`[​](/docs/reference/types/alignment#y "Direct link to y")

Represents the vertical distance from the center. It's value ranges between `-1.0` and `1.0`.

## Pre-defined alignments[​](/docs/reference/types/alignment#pre-defined-alignments "Direct link to Pre-defined alignments")

### `top_left`[​](/docs/reference/types/alignment#top_left "Direct link to top_left")

Represents the top left corner and is equivalent to `Alignment(-1.0, -1.0)`.

### `top_center`[​](/docs/reference/types/alignment#top_center "Direct link to top_center")

Represents the top center and is equivalent to `Alignment(0.0, -1.0)`.

### `top_right`[​](/docs/reference/types/alignment#top_right "Direct link to top_right")

Represents the top right corner and is equivalent to `Alignment(1.0, -1.0)`.

### `center_left`[​](/docs/reference/types/alignment#center_left "Direct link to center_left")

Represents the center left and is equivalent to `Alignment(-1.0, 0.0)`.

### `center`[​](/docs/reference/types/alignment#center "Direct link to center")

Represents the center and is equivalent to `Alignment(0.0, 0.0)`.

### `center_right`[​](/docs/reference/types/alignment#center_right "Direct link to center_right")

Represents the center right and is equivalent to `Alignment(1.0, 0.0)`.

### `bottom_left`[​](/docs/reference/types/alignment#bottom_left "Direct link to bottom_left")

Represents the bottom left corner and is equivalent to `Alignment(-1.0, 1.0)`.

### `bottom_center`[​](/docs/reference/types/alignment#bottom_center "Direct link to bottom_center")

Represents the bottom center and is equivalent to `Alignment(0.0, 1.0)`.

### `bottom_right`[​](/docs/reference/types/alignment#bottom_right "Direct link to bottom_right")

Represents the bottom right corner and is equivalent to `Alignment(1.0, 1.0)`.

## Usage example[​](/docs/reference/types/alignment#usage-example "Direct link to Usage example")

# Badge

A Material Design "badge".

Badges are used to show notifications, counts, or status information about its control, typically an icon that is a part of a NavigationBar or a NavigationRail destination or a button's icon.

The information is shown as [`text`](/docs/reference/types/badge#text) on a badge's label. If the `text` is not provided, the badge is shown as a filled circle of [`small_size`](/docs/reference/types/badge#small_size) diameter.

If `text` is provided, the label is a StadiumBorder shaped badge with height equal to [`large_size`](/docs/reference/types/badge#large_size).

# Border

`Border` class has the following properties describing 4 sides of the rectangle:

### `bottom`[​](/docs/reference/types/border#bottom "Direct link to bottom")

### `left`[​](/docs/reference/types/border#left "Direct link to left")

### `right`[​](/docs/reference/types/border#right "Direct link to right")

### `top`[​](/docs/reference/types/border#top "Direct link to top")

## Helper methods[​](/docs/reference/types/border#helper-methods "Direct link to Helper methods")

Each side of the border is described by an instance of [`BorderSide`](/docs/reference/types/borderside) class.

The below helper methods are available to ease the creation of `Border` objects:

### `border.all(width, color)`[​](/docs/reference/types/border#borderallwidth-color "Direct link to borderallwidth-color")

Sets the same border for all 4 sides of the rectangle.

### `border.symmetric(vertical, horizontal)`[​](/docs/reference/types/border#bordersymmetricvertical-horizontal "Direct link to bordersymmetricvertical-horizontal")

Sets `vertical` border for top and bottom sides and `horizontal` for the left and right sides of the rectangle.

### `border.only(left: BorderSide, top: BorderSide, right: BorderSide, bottom: BorderSide)`[​](/docs/reference/types/border#borderonlyleft-borderside-top-borderside-right-borderside-bottom-borderside "Direct link to borderonlyleft-borderside-top-borderside-right-borderside-bottom-borderside")

Sets different borders for each side of the rectangle.

## Usage example[​](/docs/reference/types/border#usage-example "Direct link to Usage example")

```
container_1.border = ft.border.all(10, ft.Colors.PINK_600)container_1.border = ft.border.only(bottom=ft.border.BorderSide(1, "black"))
```

# BoxShadow

`BoxShadow` class has the following properties:

### `blur_radius`[​](/docs/reference/types/boxshadow#blur_radius "Direct link to blur_radius")

The standard deviation of the Gaussian to convolve with the shadow's shape.

Defaults to `0.0.`.

### `blur_style`[​](/docs/reference/types/boxshadow#blur_style "Direct link to blur_style")

Value is of type [`ShadowBlurStyle`](/docs/reference/types/shadowblurstyle) and defaults to `ShadowBlurStyle.NORMAL`.

### `color`[​](/docs/reference/types/boxshadow#color "Direct link to color")

[Color](/docs/reference/colors) used to draw the shadow.

### `offset`[​](/docs/reference/types/boxshadow#offset "Direct link to offset")

An instance of `Offset` class - the displacement of the shadow from the casting element. Positive x/y offsets will shift the shadow to the right and down, while negative offsets shift the shadow to the left and up. The offsets are relative to the position of the element that is casting it.

Value is of type [`Offset`](/docs/reference/types/offset) and defaults to `Offset(0,0)`.

### `spread_radius`[​](/docs/reference/types/boxshadow#spread_radius "Direct link to spread_radius")

The amount the box should be inflated prior to applying the blur.

Defaults to `0.0.`.

## Usage example[​](/docs/reference/types/boxshadow#usage-example "Direct link to Usage example")

```
ft.Container(    border_radius=10,    width=100,    height=100,    shadow=ft.BoxShadow(        spread_radius=1,        blur_radius=15,        color=ft.Colors.BLUE_GREY_300,        offset=ft.Offset(0, 0),        blur_style=ft.ShadowBlurStyle.OUTER,    ))

You can configure a different shape, background color for a hovered state and configure fallback values for all other states.

To configure style attribute for all Material states set its value to a literal (or class instance). For example, if you set `color` property to a literal the value will be applied to all button states:

```
ButtonStyle(    color=ft.Colors.WHITE)
```

To configure style attribute for specific Material states set its value to a dictionary where the key is state name. For example, to configure different background colors for `HOVERED` and `FOCUSED` states and another colors for all other states:

```
ButtonStyle(    color={        ft.ControlState.HOVERED: ft.Colors.WHITE,        ft.ControlState.FOCUSED: ft.Colors.BLUE,        ft.ControlState.DEFAULT: ft.Colors.BLACK,    })
```

# GeolocatorAndroidSettings

`GeolocatorAndroidSettings` class has the following values:

### `accuracy`[​](/docs/reference/types/geolocatorandroidsettings#accuracy "Direct link to accuracy")

The accuracy of the location data.

Value is of type [`GeolocatorPositionAccuracy`](/docs/reference/types/geolocatorpositionaccuracy) and defaults to `GeolocatorPositionAccuracy.BEST`.

### `distance_filter`[​](/docs/reference/types/geolocatorandroidsettings#distance_filter "Direct link to distance_filter")

The minimum distance (measured in meters) a device must move horizontally before an update event is generated.

Value is of type `int` and defaults to `0`.

### `force_location_manager`[​](/docs/reference/types/geolocatorandroidsettings#force_location_manager "Direct link to force_location_manager")

Forces the Geolocator plugin to use the legacy LocationManager instead of the FusedLocationProviderClient.

Value is of type `bool` and defaults to `False`.

### `foreground_notification_text`[​](/docs/reference/types/geolocatorandroidsettings#foreground_notification_text "Direct link to foreground_notification_text")

The body used for the foreground service notification.

### `foreground_notification_title`[​](/docs/reference/types/geolocatorandroidsettings#foreground_notification_title "Direct link to foreground_notification_title")

The title used for the foreground service notification.

### `foreground_notification_enable_wake_lock`[​](/docs/reference/types/geolocatorandroidsettings#foreground_notification_enable_wake_lock "Direct link to foreground_notification_enable_wake_lock")

Whether wakelock should be acquired when background execution is started. If this is `False` then the system can still sleep and all location events will be received at once when the system wakes up again.

Wake lock permissions should be obtained first by using [`PermissionHandler`](/docs/controls/permissionhandler).

Has no effect if `foreground_notification_text` or `foreground_notification_title` are not set.

Defaults to `False`.

### `foreground_notification_enable_wifi_lock`[​](/docs/reference/types/geolocatorandroidsettings#foreground_notification_enable_wifi_lock "Direct link to foreground_notification_enable_wifi_lock")

Whether WifiLock is acquired when background execution is started. This allows the application to keep the Wi-Fi radio awake, even when the user has not used the device in a while (e. g. for background network communications).

Wifi lock permissions should be obtained first by using [`PermissionHandler`](/docs/controls/permissionhandler).

Has no effect if `foreground_notification_text` or `foreground_notification_title` are not set.

Defaults to `False`.

### `foreground_notification_color`[​](/docs/reference/types/geolocatorandroidsettings#foreground_notification_color "Direct link to foreground_notification_color")

Accent [color](/docs/reference/colors) to be applied by the standard Style templates when presenting the notification.

Has no effect if `foreground_notification_text` or `foreground_notification_title` are not set.

### `foreground_notification_channel_name`[​](/docs/reference/types/geolocatorandroidsettings#foreground_notification_channel_name "Direct link to foreground_notification_channel_name")

The user visible name of the notification channel. The notification channel name will be displayed in the system settings. The maximum recommended length is 40 characters, the name might be truncated if it is to long.

Has no effect if `foreground_notification_text` or `foreground_notification_title` are not set.

Value is of type `str` and defaults to `"Background Location"`.

### `foreground_notification_set_ongoing`[​](/docs/reference/types/geolocatorandroidsettings#foreground_notification_set_ongoing "Direct link to foreground_notification_set_ongoing")

Whether the displayed notification is persistent and the user cannot dismiss it.

Has no effect if `foreground_notification_text` or `foreground_notification_title` are not set.

Defaults to `True`.

### `interval_duration`[​](/docs/reference/types/geolocatorandroidsettings#interval_duration "Direct link to interval_duration")

The desired interval for active location updates.

Value is of type [`Duration`](/docs/reference/types/duration) and defaults to 5000 milliseconds.

### `time_limit`[​](/docs/reference/types/geolocatorandroidsettings#time_limit "Direct link to time_limit")

The timeout interval for the location request. By default there's no time limit.

Value is of type [`Duration`](/docs/reference/types/duration).

### `use_mls_altitude`[​](/docs/reference/types/geolocatorandroidsettings#use_mls_altitude "Direct link to use_mls_altitude")

Whether the altitude should be calculated as MSL (EGM2008) from NMEA messages and reported as the altitude instead of using the geoidal height (WSG84). Setting this property true will help to align Android altitude to that of iOS which uses MSL.

This property only works with position stream updates ([`Geolocator.on_position_change`](/docs/controls/geolocator#on_position_change)) and has no effect when getting the current position or last known position.

Value is of type `bool` and defaults to `False`.

# GeolocatorAppleSettings

`GeolocatorAppleSettings` class has the following values:

### `accuracy`[​](/docs/reference/types/geolocatorapplesettings#accuracy "Direct link to accuracy")

The accuracy of the location data.

Value is of type [`GeolocatorPositionAccuracy`](/docs/reference/types/geolocatorpositionaccuracy) and defaults to `GeolocatorPositionAccuracy.BEST`.

### `activity_type`[​](/docs/reference/types/geolocatorapplesettings#activity_type "Direct link to activity_type")

The location manager uses the information in this property as a cue to determine when location updates may be automatically paused.

Value is of type [`GeolocatorActivityType`](/docs/reference/types/geolocatoractivitytype) and defaults to `GeolocatorActivityType.OTHER`.

### `allow_background_location_updates`[​](/docs/reference/types/geolocatorapplesettings#allow_background_location_updates "Direct link to allow_background_location_updates")

Whether to allow the app to receive location updates in the background.

Value is of type `bool` and defaults to `True`.

### `distance_filter`[​](/docs/reference/types/geolocatorapplesettings#distance_filter "Direct link to distance_filter")

The minimum distance (measured in meters) a device must move horizontally before an update event is generated.

Value is of type `int` and defaults to `0`.

### `show_background_location_indicator`[​](/docs/reference/types/geolocatorapplesettings#show_background_location_indicator "Direct link to show_background_location_indicator")

Flag to ask the Apple OS to show the background location indicator (iOS only) if app starts up and background and requests the users location. For this setting to work and for the location to be retrieved the user must have granted "always" permissions for location retrieval.

Value is of type `bool` and defaults to `False`.

### `time_limit`[​](/docs/reference/types/geolocatorapplesettings#time_limit "Direct link to time_limit")

The timeout interval for the location request. By default there's no time limit.

Value is of type [`Duration`](/docs/reference/types/duration).

### `pause_location_updates_automatically`[​](/docs/reference/types/geolocatorapplesettings#pause_location_updates_automatically "Direct link to pause_location_updates_automatically")

Allows the location manager to pause updates to improve battery life on the target device without sacrificing location data. When this property is set to `True`, the location manager pauses updates (and powers down the appropriate hardware) at times when the location data is unlikely to change.

Value is of type `bool` and defaults to `False`.

# InputFilter

Prevents the insertion of characters matching (or not matching) a particular pattern(`regex_string`), by replacing the characters with the given `replacement_string`.

`InputFilter` class takes 3 parameters:

### `allow`[​](/docs/reference/types/inputfilter#allow "Direct link to allow")

A boolean value indicating whether to allow or deny/block the matched patterns.

Value is of type `bool` and defaults to `True`.

### `case_sensitive`[​](/docs/reference/types/inputfilter#case_sensitive "Direct link to case_sensitive")

Whether this regular expression is case sensitive.

If the regular expression is not case sensitive, it will match an input letter with a pattern letter even if the two letters are different case versions of the same letter.

### `dot_all`[​](/docs/reference/types/inputfilter#dot_all "Direct link to dot_all")

Whether "." in this regular expression matches line terminators.

When false, the "." character matches a single character, unless that character terminates a line. When true, then the "." character will match any single character including line terminators.

This feature is distinct from `multiline`. They affect the behavior of different pattern characters, so they can be used together or separately.

### `multiline`[​](/docs/reference/types/inputfilter#multiline "Direct link to multiline")

Whether this regular expression matches multiple lines.

If the regexp does match multiple lines, the "^" and "$" characters match the beginning and end of lines. If not, the characters match the beginning and end of the input.

### `regex_string`[​](/docs/reference/types/inputfilter#regex_string "Direct link to regex_string")

A regular expression pattern for the filter.

It is recommended to use raw strings (prefix your string with `r`) for the pattern, ex: `r"pattern"`.

### `replacement_string`[​](/docs/reference/types/inputfilter#replacement_string "Direct link to replacement_string")

A string used to replace banned/denied patterns. Defaults to an empty string.

### `unicode`[​](/docs/reference/types/inputfilter#unicode "Direct link to unicode")

Whether this regular expression uses Unicode mode.

## Predefined input filters[​](/docs/reference/types/inputfilter#predefined-input-filters "Direct link to Predefined input filters")

### `NumbersOnlyInputFilter()`[​](/docs/reference/types/inputfilter#numbersonlyinputfilter "Direct link to numbersonlyinputfilter")

Allows only numbers.

### `TextOnlyInputFilter()`[​](/docs/reference/types/inputfilter#textonlyinputfilter "Direct link to textonlyinputfilter")

Allows only text.

## Usage example[​](/docs/reference/types/inputfilter#usage-example "Direct link to Usage example")

```
ft.CupertinoTextField(    placeholder_text="Only numbers are allowed",    input_filter=ft.InputFilter(allow=True, regex_string=r"^[0-9]*$", replacement_string=""))
```

```
ft.TextField(    label="Only letters are allowed",    input_filter=ft.TextOnlyInputFilter())
```

# LinearGradient

`LinearGradient` class has the following properties:

### `begin`[​](/docs/reference/types/lineargradient#begin "Direct link to begin")

An instance of [`Alignment`](/docs/reference/types/alignment). The offset at which stop `0.0` of the gradient is placed.

### `colors`[​](/docs/reference/types/lineargradient#colors "Direct link to colors")

The [`colors`](/docs/reference/colors) the gradient should obtain at each of the stops. This list must contain at least two colors.

If `stops` is provided, this list must have the same length as `stops`.

### `end`[​](/docs/reference/types/lineargradient#end "Direct link to end")

An instance of [`Alignment`](/docs/reference/types/alignment). The offset at which stop `1.0` of the gradient is placed.

### `rotation`[​](/docs/reference/types/lineargradient#rotation "Direct link to rotation")

The rotation of the gradient in [radians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian), around the center-point of its bounding box.

More information on Linear gradient [here](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/painting/LinearGradient-class.html).

### `stops`[​](/docs/reference/types/lineargradient#stops "Direct link to stops")

A list of values from `0.0` to `1.0` that denote fractions along the gradient.

If provided, this list must have the same length as `colors`. If the first value is not `0.0`, then a stop with position `0.0` and a color equal to the first color in `colors` is implied. If the last value is not `1.0`, then a stop with position `1.0` and a color equal to the last color in `colors` is implied.

### `tile_mode`[​](/docs/reference/types/lineargradient#tile_mode "Direct link to tile_mode")

How this gradient should tile the plane beyond in the region before `begin` and after `end`. The value is of type [`GradientTileMode`](/docs/reference/types/gradienttilemode).

### Usage example[​](/docs/reference/types/lineargradient#usage-example "Direct link to Usage example")

# LocaleConfiguration

### `current_locale`[​](/docs/reference/types/localeconfiguration#current_locale "Direct link to current_locale")

The current locale to be used in the application. If the provided value is not present in `supported_locales`, then this property will be set to the first item of `supported_locales` (aka `supported_locales[0]`).

Value is of type [`Locale`](/docs/reference/types/locale).

### `supported_locales`[​](/docs/reference/types/localeconfiguration#supported_locales "Direct link to supported_locales")

A list of [`Locale`](/docs/reference/types/locale)s that the app plans to support. If the provided value is `None` or list is empty, this property internally defaults to `[Locale("en", "US")]` (American English locale).

Value is of type `List[Locale]`.

# StrokePattern

`StrokePattern` is a base class for stroke patterns.

The following classes inherit from `StrokePattern`:

### `SolidStrokePattern`[​](/docs/reference/types/mapstrokepattern#solidstrokepattern "Direct link to solidstrokepattern")

A solid stroke pattern.

### `DashedStrokePattern`[​](/docs/reference/types/mapstrokepattern#dashedstrokepattern "Direct link to dashedstrokepattern")

A dash stroke pattern. It has the following properties:

-   `segments`: A list of segment lengths, which can be either floats or ints.
-   `pattern_fit`: The pattern fit strategy, of type [`PatternFit`](/docs/reference/types/mappatternfit). The default value is `PatternFit.SCALE_UP`.

### `DottedStrokePattern`[​](/docs/reference/types/mapstrokepattern#dottedstrokepattern "Direct link to dottedstrokepattern")

A dot stroke pattern. It has the following properties:

-   `spacing_factor`: The spacing factor between dots, of type `OptionalNumber`.
-   `pattern_fit`: The pattern fit strategy, of type [`PatternFit`](/docs/reference/types/mappatternfit). The default value is `PatternFit.SCALE_UP`.

On this page

# MenuStyle

`MenuStyle` allows controlling the menu's visual aspects, such as shape, background and shadow colors, content padding, border width and radius.

Each individual style attribute could be configured for all or particular [Material states](/docs/reference/types/controlstate) of a menu, such as `HOVERED`, `FOCUSED`, `DISABLED` and others.

`MenuStyle` class has the following properties:

### `alignment`[​](/docs/reference/types/menustyle#alignment "Direct link to alignment")

Defines the desired alignment of the submenu when opened relative to the button that opens it.

### `bgcolor`[​](/docs/reference/types/menustyle#bgcolor "Direct link to bgcolor")

The menu's background fill color.

### `elevation`[​](/docs/reference/types/menustyle#elevation "Direct link to elevation")

The elevation of the menu's Material.

### `padding`[​](/docs/reference/types/menustyle#padding "Direct link to padding")

The padding between the menu's boundary and its child.

### `shadow_color`[​](/docs/reference/types/menustyle#shadow_color "Direct link to shadow_color")

The shadow color of the menu's Material.

### `shape`[​](/docs/reference/types/menustyle#shape "Direct link to shape")

The shape of the menu's underlying Material, an instance of [`OutlinedBorder`](/docs/reference/types/outlinedborder) class.

### `side`[​](/docs/reference/types/menustyle#side "Direct link to side")

An instance of [`BorderSide`](/docs/reference/types/borderside) class, the color and weight of the menu's outline.

### `surface_tint_color`[​](/docs/reference/types/menustyle#surface_tint_color "Direct link to surface_tint_color")

The surface tint color of the menu's Material.

## Usage example[​](/docs/reference/types/menustyle#usage-example "Direct link to Usage example")

You can configure a different shape, background color for a `HOVERED` state and configure fallback values for all other states.

To configure style attribute for all [Material states](/docs/reference/types/controlstate), set its value to a literal ( or class instance).

For example, if you set `bgcolor` property to a literal the value will be applied to all menu states:

```
ft.MenuStyle(bgcolor=ft.Colors.RED)
```

To configure style attribute for specific Material states set its value to a dictionary where the key is state name.

For example, to configure different background colors for `HOVERED` and `FOCUSED` states and another colors for all other states:

```
ft.MenuStyle(    bgcolor={        ft.ControlState.HOVERED: ft.Colors.WHITE,        ft.ControlState.FOCUSED: ft.Colors.BLUE,        ft.ControlState.DEFAULT: ft.Colors.BLACK,    })
```

The padding value for the top side of the rectangle.

### `right`[​](/docs/reference/types/padding#right "Direct link to right")

The padding value for the right side of the rectangle.

### `bottom`[​](/docs/reference/types/padding#bottom "Direct link to bottom")

The padding value for the bottom side of the rectangle.

## Helper methods[​](/docs/reference/types/padding#helper-methods "Direct link to Helper methods")

`Padding` can be created via constructor with values for specific sides or created with helper methods:

### `padding.all(value: float)`[​](/docs/reference/types/padding#paddingallvalue-float "Direct link to paddingallvalue-float")

Applies the same padding to all sides.

### `padding.symmetric(vertical, horizontal)`[​](/docs/reference/types/padding#paddingsymmetricvertical-horizontal "Direct link to paddingsymmetricvertical-horizontal")

Applies `vertical` padding to top and bottom sides and `horizontal` padding to left and right sides.

### `padding.only(left, top, right, bottom)`[​](/docs/reference/types/padding#paddingonlyleft-top-right-bottom "Direct link to paddingonlyleft-top-right-bottom")

Applies padding to the specified sides.

## Usage example[​](/docs/reference/types/padding#usage-example "Direct link to Usage example")

# PaintLinearGradient

`PaintLinearGradient` class has the following properties:

### `begin`[​](/docs/reference/types/paintlineargradient#begin "Direct link to begin")

An instance of [`Offset`](/docs/reference/types/offset). The offset at which stop 0.0 of the gradient is placed.

### `colors`[​](/docs/reference/types/paintlineargradient#colors "Direct link to colors")

The [`colors`](/docs/reference/colors) the gradient should obtain at each of the stops. This list must contain at least two colors.

If `stops` is provided, this list must have the same length as `stops`.

### `end`[​](/docs/reference/types/paintlineargradient#end "Direct link to end")

An instance of [`Offset`](/docs/reference/types/offset). The offset at which stop 1.0 of the gradient is placed.

### `stops`[​](/docs/reference/types/paintlineargradient#stops "Direct link to stops")

A list of values from `0.0` to `1.0` that denote fractions along the gradient.

If provided, this list must have the same length as `colors`. If the first value is not `0.0`, then a stop with position `0.0` and a color equal to the first color in `colors` is implied. If the last value is not `1.0`, then a stop with position `1.0` and a color equal to the last color in `colors` is implied.

### `tile_mode`[​](/docs/reference/types/paintlineargradient#tile_mode "Direct link to tile_mode")

How this gradient should tile the plane beyond in the region before `begin` and after `end`. The value is `GradientTileMode` enum with supported values: `CLAMP` (default), `DECAL`, `MIRROR`, `REPEATED`. More info [here](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/TileMode.html).

### `rotation`[​](/docs/reference/types/paintlineargradient#rotation "Direct link to rotation")

# PaintRadialGradient

`PaintRadialGradient` class has the following properties:

### `center`[​](/docs/reference/types/paintradialgradient#center "Direct link to center")

An instance of [`Offset`](/docs/reference/types/offset) class. The center of the gradient.

### `colors`[​](/docs/reference/types/paintradialgradient#colors "Direct link to colors")

The [`colors`](/docs/reference/colors) the gradient should obtain at each of the stops. This list must contain at least two colors.

If `stops` is provided, this list must have the same length as `stops`.

### `focal`[​](/docs/reference/types/paintradialgradient#focal "Direct link to focal")

The focal point of the gradient. If specified, the gradient will appear to be focused along the vector from `center` to focal.

### `focal_radius`[​](/docs/reference/types/paintradialgradient#focal_radius "Direct link to focal_radius")

The radius of the focal point of gradient, as a fraction of the shortest side of the paint box.

For example, if a radial gradient is painted on a box that is `100.0` pixels wide and `200.0` pixels tall, then a radius of `1.0` will place the `1.0` stop at `100.0` pixels from the focal point.

### `radius`[​](/docs/reference/types/paintradialgradient#radius "Direct link to radius")

The radius of the gradient.

### `rotation`[​](/docs/reference/types/paintradialgradient#rotation "Direct link to rotation")

The rotation of the gradient in [radians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian), around the center-point of its bounding box.

### `stops`[​](/docs/reference/types/paintradialgradient#stops "Direct link to stops")

A list of values from `0.0` to `1.0` that denote fractions along the gradient.

If provided, this list must have the same length as `colors`. If the first value is not `0.0`, then a stop with position `0.0` and a color equal to the first color in `colors` is implied. If the last value is not `1.0`, then a stop with position `1.0` and a color equal to the last color in `colors` is implied.

### `tile_mode`[​](/docs/reference/types/paintradialgradient#tile_mode "Direct link to tile_mode")

How this gradient should tile the plane beyond in the region before `begin` and after `end`. The value is of type [`GradientTileMode`](/docs/reference/types/gradienttilemode).

The [`colors`](/docs/reference/colors) the gradient should obtain at each of the stops. This list must contain at least two colors.

If `stops` is provided, this list must have the same length as `stops`.

### `end_angle`[​](/docs/reference/types/paintsweepgradient#end_angle "Direct link to end_angle")

The angle in radians at which stop 1.0 of the gradient is placed. Defaults to math.pi \* 2.

### `rotation`[​](/docs/reference/types/paintsweepgradient#rotation "Direct link to rotation")

The rotation of the gradient in [radians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian), around the center-point of its bounding box.

### `start_angle`[​](/docs/reference/types/paintsweepgradient#start_angle "Direct link to start_angle")

The angle in [radians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian) at which stop 0.0 of the gradient is placed. Defaults to 0.0.

### `stops`[​](/docs/reference/types/paintsweepgradient#stops "Direct link to stops")

A list of values from `0.0` to `1.0` that denote fractions along the gradient.

If provided, this list must have the same length as `colors`. If the first value is not `0.0`, then a stop with position `0.0` and a color equal to the first color in `colors` is implied. If the last value is not `1.0`, then a stop with position `1.0` and a color equal to the last color in `colors` is implied.

### `tile_mode`[​](/docs/reference/types/paintsweepgradient#tile_mode "Direct link to tile_mode")

How this gradient should tile the plane beyond in the region before `begin` and after `end`. The value is of type [`GradientTileMode`](/docs/reference/types/gradienttilemode).

#### Usage example[​](/docs/reference/types/paintsweepgradient#usage-example "Direct link to Usage example")

![](https://flet.dev/docs/reference/types/paintsweepgradient/img/docs/controls/canvas/paint-sweep-gradient.png)

```
cv.Path(    [        cv.Path.MoveTo(60, 230),        cv.Path.LineTo(110, 330),        cv.Path.LineTo(10, 330),        cv.Path.Close(),    ],    ft.Paint(        gradient=ft.PaintSweepGradient(            (60, 280),            colors=[ft.Colors.YELLOW, ft.Colors.BLUE],            start_angle=0,            end_angle=math.pi * 2,        ),        stroke_width=5,        stroke_join=ft.StrokeJoin.ROUND,        style=ft.PaintingStyle.STROKE,    ),)
```

### `stroke_cap`[​](/docs/reference/types/paintsweepgradient#stroke_cap "Direct link to stroke_cap")

The kind of finish to place on the end of lines drawn when `style` is set to `PaintingStyle.STROKE`.

The value is an instance of `ft.StrokeCap` enum:

-   `BUTT` (default) - Begin and end contours with a flat edge and no extension.
-   `ROUND` - Begin and end contours with a semi-circle extension.
-   `SQUARE` - Begin and end contours with a half square extension. This is similar to extending each contour by half the stroke width (as given by `Paint.stroke_width`).

### `stroke_join`[​](/docs/reference/types/paintsweepgradient#stroke_join "Direct link to stroke_join")

The kind of finish to place on the joins between segments.

This applies to paths drawn when style is set to `PaintingStyle.STROKE`, It does not apply to points drawn as lines with `canvas.Points`.

Defaults to `StrokeJoin.MITER`, i.e. sharp corners.

Value is of type [`StrokeJoin`](/docs/reference/types/strokejoin).

See [StrokeJoin enum](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/StrokeJoin.html) in Flutter documentation for more details.

### `stroke_miter_limit`[​](/docs/reference/types/paintsweepgradient#stroke_miter_limit "Direct link to stroke_miter_limit")

The limit for miters to be drawn on segments when the join is set to `StrokeJoin.MITER` and the style is set to `PaintingStyle.STROKE`. If this limit is exceeded, then a `StrokeJoin.BEVEL` join will be drawn instead. This may cause some 'popping' of the corners of a path if the angle between line segments is animated, as seen in the diagrams below.

This limit is expressed as a limit on the length of the miter.

Defaults to 4.0. Using zero as a limit will cause a `StrokeJoin.BEVEL` join to be used all the time.

### `stroke_width`[​](/docs/reference/types/paintsweepgradient#stroke_width "Direct link to stroke_width")

How wide to make edges drawn when style is set to `PaintingStyle.STROKE`. The width is given in logical pixels measured in the direction orthogonal to the direction of the path.

Defaults to 0.0, which correspond to a hairline width.

### `stroke_dash_pattern`[​](/docs/reference/types/paintsweepgradient#stroke_dash_pattern "Direct link to stroke_dash_pattern")

A circular array of dash offsets and lengths.

For example, the array `[5, 10]` would result in dashes 5 pixels long followed by blank spaces 10 pixels long. The array `[5, 10, 5]` would result in a 5 pixel dash, a 10 pixel gap, a 5 pixel dash, a 5 pixel gap, a 10 pixel dash, etc.

### `style`[​](/docs/reference/types/paintsweepgradient#style "Direct link to style")

Whether to paint inside shapes, the edges of shapes, or both.

The value is an instance of `ft.PaintingStyle` enum:

-   `FILL` (default) - Apply the `Paint` to the inside of the shape. For example, when applied to the `canvas.Circle` shape, this results in a disc of the given size being painted.
-   `STROKE` - Apply the `Paint` to the edge of the shape. For example, when applied to the `canvas.Circle` shape, this results is a hoop of the given size being painted. The line drawn on the edge will be the width given by the `Paint.stroke_width` property.

Background [color](/docs/reference/colors) of the section.

### `border_side`[​](/docs/reference/types/piechartsection#border_side "Direct link to border_side")

The border around section shape.

Value is of type [`BorderSide`](/docs/reference/types/borderside).

### `title`[​](/docs/reference/types/piechartsection#title "Direct link to title")

A title drawn at the center of the section. No title is drawn if `title` is empty.

### `title_style`[​](/docs/reference/types/piechartsection#title_style "Direct link to title_style")

The style to draw `title` with. The value is an instance of [`TextStyle`](/docs/reference/types/textstyle) class.

### `title_position`[​](/docs/reference/types/piechartsection#title_position "Direct link to title_position")

By default title is drawn in the middle of the section, but its position can be changed with `title_position` property which value must be between `0.0` (near the center) and `1.0`(near the outside of the pie chart).

### `badge`[​](/docs/reference/types/piechartsection#badge "Direct link to badge")

An optional `Control` drawn in the middle of a section.

### `badge_position`[​](/docs/reference/types/piechartsection#badge_position "Direct link to badge_position")

By default the badge is drawn in the middle of the section, but its position can be changed with `badge_position` property which value must be between `0.0` (near the center) and `1.0`(near the outside of the pie chart).

# RadialGradient

`RadialGradient` class has the following properties:

### `colors`[​](/docs/reference/types/radialgradient#colors "Direct link to colors")

### `stops`[​](/docs/reference/types/radialgradient#stops "Direct link to stops")

### `tile_mode`[​](/docs/reference/types/radialgradient#tile_mode "Direct link to tile_mode")

How this gradient should tile the plane beyond in the region before `begin` and after `end`. The value is of type [`GradientTileMode`](/docs/reference/types/gradienttilemode).

### `rotation`[​](/docs/reference/types/radialgradient#rotation "Direct link to rotation")

The rotation of the gradient in [radians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian), around the center-point of its bounding box.

### `center`[​](/docs/reference/types/radialgradient#center "Direct link to center")

An instance of [`Alignment`](/docs/reference/types/alignment) class. The center of the gradient, as an offset into the (-1.0, -1.0) x (1.0, 1.0) square describing the gradient which will be mapped onto the paint box. For example, an alignment of (0.0, 0.0) will place the radial gradient in the center of the box.

### `radius`[​](/docs/reference/types/radialgradient#radius "Direct link to radius")

The radius of the gradient, as a fraction of the shortest side of the paint box. For example, if a radial gradient is painted on a box that is 100.0 pixels wide and 200.0 pixels tall, then a radius of 1.0 will place the 1.0 stop at 100.0 pixels from the `center`.

### `focal`[​](/docs/reference/types/radialgradient#focal "Direct link to focal")

The focal point of the gradient. If specified, the gradient will appear to be focused along the vector from `center` to focal.

### `focal_radius`[​](/docs/reference/types/radialgradient#focal_radius "Direct link to focal_radius")

The radius of the focal point of gradient, as a fraction of the shortest side of the paint box. For example, if a radial gradient is painted on a box that is 100.0 pixels wide and 200.0 pixels tall, then a radius of 1.0 will place the 1.0 stop at 100.0 pixels from the focal point.
